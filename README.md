A repository for a Probability and Statistics Hackathon conducted at Bennett University during 5-6th November, 2022.

## The idea

The main idea of the project is to take a user input in the form of a speech transcript/article, and then use basic statistical analysis to grade the speech on a spider chart consisting of 5 axes -

- information
- persuasion
- demonstration 
- entertainment 
- special occasion (ceremony, tribute, etc.)
  
A seperate component (targeted) that uses KNN to find out what the speech is closest to, with an existing dataset of some famous speeches and addresses.

## The approach
