Eighth Annual Message to Congress,07-12-1796,George Washington,"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:

In recurring to the internal situation of our Country, since I had last the pleasure to Address you, I find ample reason for a renewed expression of that gratitude to the ruler of the Universe, which a continued series of prosperity has so often and so justly called forth.

The Acts of the last Session, which required special arrangements, have been, as far as circumstances would admit, carried into operation.

Measures calculated to insure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians, and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier, have been digested and adopted. In the framing of these, care has been taken to guard on the one hand, our advanced Settlements from the predatory incursions of those unruly Individuals, who cannot be restrained by their Tribes; and on the other hand, to protect the rights secured to the Indians by Treaty; to draw them nearer to the civilized state; and inspire them with correct conceptions of the Power, as well as justice of the Government.

The meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain, in the State of Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their land, by that State, broke up without its being accomplished; the Nation having, previous to their departure, instructed them against making any Sale; the occasion however has been improved, to confirm by a new Treaty with the Creeks, their pre-existing engagements with the United States; and to obtain their consent, to the establishment of Trading Houses and Military Posts within their boundary; by means of which, their friendship, and the general peace, may be more effectually secured.

The period during the late Session, at which the appropriation was passed, for carrying into effect the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, between the United States and his Britannic Majesty, necessarily procrastinated the reception of the Posts stipulated to be delivered, beyond the date assigned for that event. As soon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addressed with propriety on the subject, arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded for their evacuation; and the United States took possession of the principal of them, comprehending Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michelimackina, and Fort Miami; where, such repairs, and additions have been ordered to be made, as appeared indispensible.

The Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great Britain, to determine which is the river St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson Esqr. of New York, for the third Commissioner. The whole met at St. Andrews, in Passamaquoddy Bay, in the beginning of October; and directed surveys to be made of the Rivers in dispute; but deeming it impracticable to have these Surveys completed before the next Year, they adjourned, to meet at Boston in August 1797, for the final decision of the question.

Other Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States, agreeably to the seventh Article of the Treaty with Great Britain, relative to captures and condemnations of Vessels and other property, met the Commissioners of his Britannic Majesty in London, in August last, when John Trumbull, Esqr. was chosen by lot, for the fifth Commissioner. In October following the Board were to proceed to business. As yet there has been no communication of Commissioners on the part of Great Britain, to unite with those who have been appointed on the part of the United States, for carrying into effect the sixth Article of the Treaty.

The Treaty with Spain, required, that the Commissioners for running the boundary line between the territory of the United States, and his Catholic Majesty's Provinces of East and West Florida, should meet at the Natchez, before the expiration of six Months after the exchange of the ratifications, which was effected at Aranjuez on the 25th. day of April; and the troops of his Catholic Majesty occupying any Posts within the limits of the United States, were within the same period to be withdrawn. The Commissioner of the United States therefore, commenced his journey for the Natchez in September; and troops were ordered to occupy the Posts from which the Spanish Garrisons should be withdrawn. Information has been recently received, of the appointment of a Commissioner on the part of his Catholic Majesty for running the boundary line, but none of any appointment, for the adjustment of the claims of our Citizens, whose Vessels were captured by the Armed Vessels of Spain.

In pursuance of the Act of Congress, passed in the last Session, for the protection and relief of American Seamen, Agents were appointed, one to reside in Great Britain, and the other in the West Indies. The effects of the Agency in the West Indies, are not yet fully ascertained; but those which have been communicated afford grounds to believe, the measure will be beneficial. The Agent destined to reside in Great Britain, declining to accept the appointment, the business has consequently devolved on the Minister of the United States in London; and will command his attention, until a new Agent shall be appointed.

After many delays and disappointments, arising out of the European War, the final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Algiers, will, in all present appearance, be crowned with success: but under great, tho' inevitable disadvantages, in the pecuniary transactions, occasioned by that War; which will render a further provision necessary. The actual liberation of all our Citizens who were prisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling heart, is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the whole negotiation. Measures are in operation for effecting Treaties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.

To an active external Commerce, the protection of a Naval force is indispensable. This is manifest with regard to Wars in which a State itself is a party. But besides this, it is in our own experience, that the most sincere Neutrality is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of Nations at War. To secure respect to a Neutral Flag, requires a Naval force, organized, and ready to vindicate it, from insult or aggression. This may even prevent the necessity of going to War, by discouraging belligerent Powers from committing such violations of the rights of the Neutral party, as may first or last, leave no other option. From the best information I have been able to obtain, it would seem as if our trade to the mediterranean, without a protecting force, will always be insecure; and our Citizens exposed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but just been relieved.

These considerations invite the United States, to look to the means, and to set about the gradual creation of a Navy. The increasing progress of their Navigation, promises them, at no distant period, the requisite supply of Seamen; and their means, in other respects, favour the undertaking. It is an encouragement, likewise, that their particular situation, will give weight and influence to a moderate Naval force in their hands. Will it not then be adviseable, to begin without delay, to provide, and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of Ships of War; and to proceed in the Work by degrees, in proportion as our resources shall render it practicable without inconvenience; so that a future War of Europe, may not find our Commerce in the same unprotected state, in which it was found by the present.

Congress have repeatedly, and not without success, directed their attention to the encouragement of Manufactures. The object is of too much consequence, not to insure a continuance of their efforts, in every way which shall appear eligible. As a general rule, Manufactures on public account, are inexpedient. But where the state of things in a Country, leaves little hope that certain branches of Manufacture will, for a great length of time obtain; when these are of a nature essential to the furnishing and equipping of the public force in time of War, are not establishments for procuring them on public account, to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service, recommended by strong considerations of National policy, as an exception to the general rule? Ought our Country to remain in such cases, dependant on foreign supply, precarious, because liable to be interrupted? If the necessary Articles should, in this mode cost more in time of peace, will not the security and independence thence arising, form an ample compensation? Establishments of this sort, commensurate only with the calls of the public service in time of peace, will, in time of War, easily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the Government; and may even perhaps be made to yield a surplus for the supply of our Citizens at large; so as to mitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade. If adopted, the plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already, or likely soon to be, established in the Country; in order that there may be no danger of interference with pursuits of individual industry.

It will not be doubted, that with reference either to individual, or National Welfare, Agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as Nations advance in population, and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more apparent; and renders the cultivation of the Soil more and more, an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting it, grow up, supported by the public purse: and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of Boards, composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing information, and enabled by premiums, and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase of improvement; by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common centre, the results everywhere of individual skill and observation; and spreading them thence over the whole Nation. Experience accordingly has shewn, that they are very cheap Instruments, of immense National benefits.

I have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress, the expediency of establishing a National University; and also a Military Academy. The desirableness of both these Institutions, has so constantly increased with every new view I have taken of the subject, that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for all, recalling your attention to them.

The Assembly to which I address myself, is too enlightened not to be fully sensible how much a flourishing state of the Arts and Sciences, contributes to National prosperity and reputation. True it is, that our Country, much to its honor, contains many Seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful; but the funds upon which they rest, are too narrow, to command the ablest Professors, in the different departments of liberal knowledge, for the Institution contemplated, though they would be excellent auxiliaries.

Amongst the motives to such an Institution, the assimilation of the principles, opinions and manners of our Country men, but the common education of a portion of our Youth from every quarter, well deserves attention. The more homogeneous our Citizens can be made in these particulars, the greater will be our prospect of permanent Union; and a primary object of such a National Institution should be, the education of our Youth in the science of Government . In a Republic, what species of knowledge can be equally important? and what duty, more pressing on its Legislature, than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those, who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the Country?

The Institution of a Military Academy, is also recommended by cogent reasons. However pacific the general policy of a Nation may be, it ought never to be without an adequate stock of Military knowledge for emergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character, and both would hazard its safety, or expose it to greater evils when War could not be avoided. Besides that War, might often, not depend upon its own choice. In proportion, as the observance of pacific maxims, might exempt a Nation from the necessity of practising the rules of the Military Art, ought to be its care in preserving, and transmitting by proper establishments, the knowledge of that Art. Whatever argument may be drawn from particular examples, superficially viewed, a thorough examination of the subject will evince, that the Art of War, is at once comprehensive and complicated; that it demands much previous study; and that the possession of it, in its most improved and perfect state, is always of great moment to the security of a Nation. This, therefore, ought to be a serious care of every Government: and for this purpose, an Academy, where a regular course of Instruction is given, is an obvious expedient, which different Nations have successfully employed.

The compensations to the Officers of the United States, in various instances, and in none more than in respect to the most important stations, appear to call for Legislative revision. The consequences of a defective provision, are of serious import to the Government. If private wealth, is to supply the defect of public retribution, it will greatly contract the sphere within which, the selection of Characters for Office, is to be made, and will proportionally diminish the probability of a choice of Men, able, as well as upright: Besides that it would be repugnant to the vital principles of our Government, virtually to exclude from public trusts, talents and virtue, unless accompanied by wealth.

While in our external relations, some serious inconveniences and embarrassments have been overcome, and others lessened, it is with much pain and deep regret I mention, that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature, have lately occurred. Our trade has suffered, and is suffering, extensive injuries in the West Indies, from the Cruisers, and Agents of the French Republic; and communications have been received from its Minister here, which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our Commerce, by its authority; and which are, in other respects, far from agreeable.

It has been my constant, sincere, and earnest wish, in conformity with that of our Nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and a perfectly friendly understanding with that Republic. This wish remains unabated; and I shall persevere in the endeavour to fulfil it, to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with a just, and indispensable regard to the rights and honour of our Country; nor will I easily cease to cherish the expectation, that a spirit of justice, candour and friendship, on the part of the Republic, will eventually ensure success.

In pursuing this course however, I cannot forget what is due to the character of our Government and Nation; or to a full and entire confidence in the good sense, patriotism, selfrespect, and fortitude of my Countrymen.

I reserve for a special Message a more particular communication on this interesting subject.

Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have directed an estimate of the Appropriations, necessary for the service of the ensuing year, to be submitted from the proper Department; with a view of the public receipts and expenditures, to the latest period to which an account can be prepared.

It is with satisfaction I am able to inform you, that the Revenues of the United States continue in a state of progressive improvement.

A reinforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public Debt, was mentioned in my Address at the opening of the last Session. Some preliminary steps were taken towards it, the maturing of which will, no doubt, engage your zealous attention during the present. I will only add, that it will afford me, heart felt satisfaction, to concur in such further measures, as will ascertain to our Country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the Debt. Posterity may have cause to regret, if, from any motive, intervals of tranquillity are left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.

Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: My solicitude to see the Militia of the United States placed on an efficient establishment, has been so often, and so ardently expressed, that I shall but barely recall the subject to your view on the present occasion; at the same time that I shall submit to your enquiry, whether our Harbours are yet sufficiently secured.

The situation in which I now stand, for the last time, in the midst of the Representatives of the People of the United States, naturally recalls the period when the Administration of the present form of Government commenced; and I cannot omit the occasion, to congratulate you and my Country, on the success of the experiment; nor to repeat my fervent supplications to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations, that his Providential care may still be extended to the United States; that the virtue and happiness of the People, may be preserved; and that the Government, which they have instituted, for the protection of their liberties, maybe perpetual.",Persuasive
Declaration of Independence Anniversary Commemoration,05-07-1926,Calvin Coolidge,"Fellow Countrymen:
We meet to celebrate the birthday of America. That coming of a new life always excites our interest. Although we know in the case of the individual that it has been an infinite repetition reaching back beyond our vision, that only makes it more wonderful. But how our interest and wonder increase when we behold the miracle of the birth of a new nation. It is to pay our tribute of reverence and respect to those who participated in such a mighty event that we annually observe the 4th day of July. Whatever may have been the impression created by the news which went out from this city on that summer day in 1776, there can be no doubt as to the estimate which is now placed upon it. At the end of 150 years the four corners of the earth unite in coming to Philadelphia as to a holy shrine in grateful acknowledgment of a service so great, which a few inspired men here rendered to humanity, that it is still the preeminent support of free government throughout the world.
Although a century and a half measured in comparison with the length of human experience is but a short time, yet measured in the life of governments and nations it ranks as a very respectable period. Certainly enough time has elapsed to demonstrate with a great real of thoroughness the value of our institutions and their dependability as rules for the regulation of human conduct and the advancement of civilization. They have been in existence long enough to become very well seasoned. They have met, and met successfully, the test of experience
It is not so much, then, for the purpose of undertaking to proclaim new theories and principles that this annual celebration is maintained, but rather to reaffirm and reestablish those old theories and principles which time and the unerring logic of events have demonstrated to be sound. Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics, every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States with the assurance and confidence that those two great charters of freedom and justice remain firm and unshaken. Whatever perils appear, whatever dangers threaten, the Nation remains secure in the knowledge that the ultimate application of the law of the land will provide an adequate defense and protection.
It is little wonder that people at home and abroad consider Independence Hall as hallowed ground and revere the Liberty Bell as a sacred relic. That pile of bricks and mortar, that mass of metal, might appear to the uninstructed as only the outgrown meeting place and the shattered bell of a former time, useless now because of more modern conveniences, but to those who know they have become consecrated by the use which men have made of them. They have long been identified with a great cause. They are the framework of a spiritual event. The world looks upon them, because of their associations of one hundred and fifty years ago, as it looks upon the Holy Land because of what took place there nineteen hundred years ago. Through use for a righteous purpose they have become sanctified.
It is not here necessary to examine in detail the causes which led to the American Revolution. In their immediate occasion they were largely economic. The colonists objected to the navigation laws which interfered with their trade, they denied the power of Parliament to impose taxes which they were obliged to pay, and they therefore resisted the royal governors and the royal forces which were sent to secure obedience to these laws. But the conviction is inescapable that a new civilization had come, a new spirit had arisen on this side of the Atlantic more advanced and more developed in its regard for the rights of the individual than that which characterized the Old World. Life in a new and open country had aspirations which could not be realized in any subordinate position. A separate establishment was ultimately inevitable. It had been decreed by the very laws of human nature. Man everywhere has an unconquerable desire to be the master of his own destiny.
We are obliged to conclude that the Declaration of Independence represented the movement of a people. It was not, of course, a movement from the top. Revolutions do not come from that direction. It was not without the support of many of the most respectable people in the Colonies, who were entitled to all the consideration that is given to breeding, education, and possessions. It had the support of another element of great significance and importance to which I shall later refer. But the preponderance of all those who occupied a position which took on the aspect of aristocracy did not approve of the Revolution and held toward it an attitude either of neutrality or open hostility. It was in no sense a rising of the oppressed and downtrodden. It brought no scum to the surface, for the reason that colonial society had developed no scum. The great body of the people were accustomed to privations, but they were free from depravity. If they had poverty, it was not of the hopeless kind that afflicts great cities, but the inspiring kind that marks the spirit of the pioneer. The American Revolution represented the informed and mature convictions of a great mass of independent, liberty loving, God-fearing people who knew their rights, and possessed the courage to dare to maintain them.
The Continental Congress was not only composed of great men, but it represented a great people. While its Members did not fail to exercise a remarkable leadership, they were equally observant of their representative capacity. They were industrious in encouraging their constituents to instruct them to support independence. But until such instructions were given they were inclined to withhold action.
While North Carolina has the honor of first authorizing its delegates to concur with other Colonies in declaring independence, it was quickly followed by South Carolina and Georgia, which also gave general instructions broad enough to include such action. But the first instructions which unconditionally directed its delegates to declare for independence came from the great Commonwealth of Virginia. These were immediately followed by Rhode Island and Massachusetts, while the other Colonies, with the exception of New York, soon adopted a like course.
This obedience of the delegates to the wishes of their constituents, which in some cases caused them to modify their previous positions, is a matter of great significance. It reveals an orderly process of government in the first place; but more than that, it demonstrates that the Declaration of Independence was the result of the seasoned and deliberate thought of the dominant portion of the people of the Colonies. Adopted after long discussion and as the result of the duly authorized expression of the preponderance of public opinion, it did not partake of dark intrigue or hidden conspiracy. It was well advised. It had about it nothing of the lawless and disordered nature of a riotous insurrection. It was maintained on a plane which rises above the ordinary conception of rebellion. It was in no sense a radical movement but took on the dignity of a resistance to illegal usurpations. It was conservative and represented the action of the colonists to maintain their constitutional rights which from time immemorial had been guaranteed to them under the law of the land.
When we come to examine the action of the Continental Congress in adopting the Declaration of Independence in the light of what was set out in that great document and in the light of succeeding events, we can not escape the conclusion that it had a much broader and deeper significance than a mere secession if territory and the establishment of a new nation. Events of that nature have been taking place since the dawn of history. One empire after another has arisen, only to crumble away as its constituent parts separated from each other and set up independent governments of their own. Such actions long ago became commonplace. They have occurred too often to hold the attention of the world and command the administration and reverence of humanity. There is something beyond the establishment of a new nation, great as that event would be, in the Declaration of Independence which has ever since caused it to be regarded as one of the great charters that not only was to liberate America but was everywhere to ennoble humanity.
It was not because it was proposed to establish a new nation, but because it was proposed to establish a nation on new principles, that July 4, 1776, has come to be regarded as one of the greatest days in history. Great ideas do not burst upon the world unannounced. They are reached by a gradual development over a length of time usually proportionate to their importance. This is especially true of the principles laid down in the Declaration of Independence. Three very definite propositions were set out in its preamble regarding the nature of mankind and therefore of government. These were the doctrine that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that therefore the source of the just powers of government must be derived from the consent of the governed.
If no one is to be accounted as born into a superior station, if there is to be no ruling class, and if all possess rights which can neither be bartered away nor taken from them by any earthly power, it follows as a matter of course that the practical authority of the Government has to rest on the consent of the governed. While these principles were not altogether new in political action, and were very far from new in political speculation, they had never been assembled before and declared in such a combination. But remarkable as this may be, it is not the chief distinction of the Declaration of Independence. The importance of political speculation is not to be underestimated, as I shall presently disclose. Until the idea is developed and the plan made there can be no action.
It was the fact that our Declaration of Independence containing these immortal truths was the political action of a duly authorized and constituted representative public body in its sovereign capacity, supported by the force of general opinion and by the armies of Washington already in the field, which makes it the most important civil document in the world. It was not only the principles declared, but the fact that therewith a new nation was born which was to be founded upon those principles and which from that time forth in its development has actually maintained those principles, that makes this pronouncement an incomparable event in the history of government. It was an assertion that a people had arisen determined to make every necessary sacrifice for the support of these truths and by their practical application bring the War of Independence to a successful conclusion and adopt the Constitution of the United States with all that it has meant to civilization.
The idea that the people have a right to choose their own rulers was not new in political history. It was the foundation of every popular attempt to depose an undesirable king. This right was set out with a good deal of detail by the Dutch when as early as July 26, 1581, they declared their independence of Philip of Spain. In their long struggle with the Stuarts the British people asserted the same principles, which finally culminated in the Bill of Rights deposing the last of that house and placing William and Mary on the throne. In each of these cases sovereignty through divine right was displaced by sovereignty through the consent of the people. Running through the same documents, though expressed in different terms, is the clear inference of inalienable rights. But we should search these charters in vain for an assertion of the doctrine of equality. This principle had not before appeared as an official political declaration of any nation. It was profoundly revolutionary. It is one of the corner stones of American institutions.
But if these truths to which the Declaration refers have not before been adopted in their combined entirely by national authority, it is a fact that they had been long pondered and often expressed in political speculation. It is generally assumed that French thought had some effect upon our public mind during Revolutionary days. This may have been true. But the principles of our Declaration had been under discussion in the Colonies for nearly two generations before the advent of the French political philosophy that characterized the middle of the eighteenth century. In fact, they come from an earlier date. A very positive echo of what the Dutch had done in 1581, and what the English were preparing to do, appears in the assertion of the Rev. Thomas Hooker, of Connecticut, as early as 1638, when he said in a sermon before the General Court that--
The foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people.
The choice of public magistrates belongs to the people by God's own allowance.
This doctrine found wide acceptance among the nonconformist clergy who later made up the Congregational Church. The great apostle of this movement was the Rev. John Wise, of Massachusetts. He was one of the leaders of the revolt against the royal governor Andross in 1687, for which he suffered imprisonment. He was a liberal in ecclesiastical controversies. He appears to have been familiar with the writings of the political scientist, Samuel Pufendorf, who was born in Saxony in 1632. Wise published a treatise entitled ""The Church's Quarrel Espoused"" in 1710, which was amplified in another publication in 1717. In it he dealt with the principles of civil government. His works were reprinted in 1772 and have been declared to have been nothing less than a textbook of liberty for our Revolutionary fathers.
While the written word was the foundation, it is apparent that the spoken word was the vehicle for convincing the people. This came with great force and wide range from the successors of Hooker and Wise. It was carried on with a missionary spirit which did not fail to reach the Scotch-Irish of North Carolina, showing its influence by significantly making that Colony the first to give instructions to its delegates looking to independence. This preaching reached the neighborhood of Thomas Jefferson, who acknowledged that his ""best ideas of democracy"" had been secured at church meetings.
That these ideas were prevalent in Virginia is further revealed by the Declaration of Rights, which was prepared by George Mason and presented to the general assembly on May 27, 1776. This document asserted popular sovereignty and inherent natural rights, but confined the doctrine of equality to the assertion that ""All men are created equally free and independent."" It can scarcely be imagined that Jefferson was unacquainted with what had been done in his own Commonwealth of Virginia when he took up the task of drafting the Declaration of Independence. But these thoughts can very largely be traced back to what John Wise was writing in 1710. He said, ""Every man must be acknowledged equal to very man."" Again, ""The end of all good government is to cultivate humanity and promote the happiness of all and the good of every man in all his rights, his life, liberty, estate, honor, and so forth * * *.""
And again, ""For as they have a power every man in his natural state, so upon combination they can and do bequeath this power to others and settle it according as their united discretion shall determine."" And still again, ""Democracy is Christ's government in church and state."" Here was the doctrine of equality, popular sovereignty, and the substance of the theory of inalienable rights clearly asserted by Wise at the opening of the eighteenth century, just as we have the principle of the consent of the governed state by Hooker as early as 1638.
When we take all these circumstances into consideration, it is but natural that the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence should open with a reference to Nature's God and should close in the final paragraphs with an appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world and an assertion of a firm reliance on Divine Providence. Coming from these sources, having as it did this background, it is no wonder that Samuel Adams could say ""The people seem to recognize this resolution as though it were a decree promulgated from heaven.""
No one can examine this record and escape the conclusion that in the great outline of its principles the Declaration was the result of the religious teachings of the preceding period. The profound philosophy which Jonathan Edwards applied to theology, the popular preaching of George Whitefield, had aroused the thought and stirred the people of the Colonies in preparation for this great event. No doubt the speculations which had been going on in England, and especially on the Continent, lent their influence to the general sentiment of the times. Of course, the world is always influenced by all the experience and all the thought of the past. But when we come to a contemplation of the immediate conception of the principles of human relationship which went into the Declaration of Independence we are not required to extend our search beyond our own shores. They are found in the texts, the sermons, and the writings of the early colonial clergy who were earnestly undertaking to instruct their congregations in the great mystery of how to live. They preached equality because they believed in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. They justified freedom by the text that we are all created in the divine image, all partakers of the divine spirit.
Placing every man on a plane where he acknowledged no superiors, where no one possessed any right to rule over him, he must inevitably choose his own rulers through a system of self-government. This was their theory of democracy. In those days such doctrines would scarcely have been permitted to flourish and spread in any other country. This was the purpose which the fathers cherished. In order that they might have freedom to express these thoughts and opportunity to put them into action, whole congregations with their pastors had migrated to the Colonies. These great truths were in the air that our people breathed. Whatever else we may say of it, the Declaration of Independence was profoundly American.
If this apprehension of the facts be correct, and the documentary evidence would appear to verify it, then certain conclusions are bound to follow. A spring will cease to flow if its source be dried up; a tree will wither if it roots be destroyed. In its main features the Declaration of Independence is a great spiritual document. It is a declaration not of material but of spiritual conceptions. Equality, liberty, popular sovereignty, the rights of man - these are not elements which we can see and touch. They are ideals. They have their source and their roots in the religious convictions. They belong to the unseen world. Unless the faith of the American people in these religious convictions is to endure, the principles of our Declaration will perish. We can not continue to enjoy the result if we neglect and abandon the cause.
We are too prone to overlook another conclusion. Governments do not make ideals, but ideals make governments. This is both historically and logically true. Of course the government can help to sustain ideals and can create institutions through which they can be the better observed, but their source by their very nature is in the people. The people have to bear their own responsibilities. There is no method by which that burden can be shifted to the government. It is not the enactment, but the observance of laws, that creates the character of a nation.
About the Declaration there is a finality that is exceedingly restful. It is often asserted that the world has made a great deal of progress since 1776, that we have had new thoughts and new experiences which have given us a great advance over the people of that day, and that we may therefore very well discard their conclusions for something more modern. But that reasoning can not be applied to this great charter. If all men are created equal, that is final. If they are endowed with inalienable rights, that is final. If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions. If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their soundness, the only direction in which he can proceed historically is not forward, but backward toward the time when there was no equality, no rights of the individual, no rule of the people. Those who wish to proceed in that direction can not lay claim to progress. They are reactionary. Their ideas are not more modern, but more ancient, than those of the Revolutionary fathers.
In the development of its institutions America can fairly claim that it has remained true to the principles which were declared 150 years ago. In all the essentials we have achieved an equality which was never possessed by any other people. Even in the less important matter of material possessions we have secured a wider and wider distribution of wealth. The rights of the individual are held sacred and protected by constitutional guaranties which even the Government itself is bound not to violate. If there is any one thing among us that is established beyond question, it is self-government - the right of the people to rule. If there is any failure in respect to any of these principles, it is because there is a failure on the part of individuals to observe them. We hold that the duly authorized expression of the will of the people has a divine sanction. But even in that we come back to the theory of John Wise that ""Democracy is Christ's government * * *."" The ultimate sanction of law rests on the righteous authority of the Almighty.
On an occasion like this great temptation exists to present evidence of the practical success of our form of democratic republic at home and the ever-broadening acceptance it is securing abroad. Although these things are well known, their frequent consideration is an encouragement and an inspiration. But it is not results and effects so much as sources and causes that I believe it is even more necessary constantly to contemplate. Ours is a government of the people. It represents their will. Its officers may sometimes go astray, but that is not a reason for criticizing the principles of our institutions. The real heart of the American Government depends upon the heart of the people. It is from that source that we must look for all genuine reform. It is to that cause that we must ascribe all our results.
It was in the contemplation of these truths that the fathers made their declaration and adopted their Constitution. It was to establish a free government, which must not be permitted to degenerate into the unrestrained authority of a mere majority or the unbridled weight of a mere influential few. They undertook to balance these interests against each other and provide the three separate independent branches, the executive, the legislative, and the judicial departments of the Government, with checks against each other in order that neither one might encroach upon the other. These are our guarantees of liberty. As a result of these methods enterprise has been duly protected from confiscation, the people have been free from oppression, and there has been an ever-broadening and deepening of the humanities of life.
Under a system of popular government there will always be those who will seek for political preferment by clamoring for reform. While there is very little of this which is not sincere, there is a large portion that is not well informed. In my opinion very little of just criticism can attach to the theories and principles of our institutions. There is far more danger of harm than there is hope of good in any radical changes. We do need a better understanding and comprehension of them and a better knowledge of the foundations of government in general Our forefathers came to certain conclusions and decided upon certain courses of action which have been a great blessing to the world. Before we can understand their conclusions we must go back and review the course which they followed. We must think the thoughts which they thought. Their intellectual life centered around the meetinghouse. They were intent upon religious worship. While there were always among them men of deep learning, and later those who had comparatively large possessions, the mind of the people was not so much engrossed in how much they knew, or how much they had, as in how they were going to live. While scantily provided with other literature, there was a wide acquaintance with the Scriptures. Over a period as great as that which measures the existence of our independence they were subject to this discipline not only in their religious life and educational training, but also in their political thought. They were a people who came under the influence of a great spiritual development and acquired a great moral power.
No other theory is adequate to explain or comprehend the Declaration of Independence. It is the product of the spiritual insight of the people. We live in an age of science and of abounding accumulation of material things. These did not create our Declaration. Our Declaration created them. The things of the spirit come first. Unless we cling to that, all our material prosperity, overwhelming though it may appear, will turn to a barren scepter in our grasp. If we are to maintain the great heritage which has been bequeathed to us, we must be like-minded as the fathers who created it. We must not sink into a pagan materialism. We must cultivate the reverence which they had for the things that are holy. We must follow the spiritual and moral leadership which they showed. We must keep replenished, that they may glow with a more compelling flame, the altar fires before which they worshiped.",Persuasive
Address on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,26-07-1963,John F. Kennedy,"Good evening, my fellow citizens:
I speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope. Eighteen years ago the advent of nuclear weapons changed the course of the world as well as the war. Since that time, all mankind has been struggling to escape from the darkening prospect of mass destruction on earth. In an age when both sides have come to possess enough nuclear power to destroy the human race several times over, the world of communism and the world of free choice have been caught up in a vicious circle of conflicting ideology and interest. Each increase of tension has produced an increase of arms; each increase of arms has produced an increase of tension.
In these years, the United States and the Soviet Union have frequently communicated suspicion and warnings to each other, but very rarely hope. Our representatives have met at the summit and at the brink; they have met in Washington and in Moscow; in Geneva and at the United Nations. But too often these meetings have produced only darkness, discord, or disillusion.
Yesterday a shaft of light cut into the darkness. Negotiations were concluded in Moscow on a treaty to ban all nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under water. For the first time, an agreement has been reached on bringing the forces of nuclear destruction under international control?a goal first sought in 1946 when Bernard Baruch presented a comprehensive control plan to the United Nations.
That plan, and many subsequent disarmament plans, large and small, have all been blocked by those opposed to international inspection. A ban on nuclear tests, however, requires on-the-spot inspection only for underground tests. This Nation now possesses a variety of techniques to detect the nuclear tests of other nations which are conducted in the air or under water, for such tests produce unmistakable signs which our modern instruments can pick up.
The treaty initialed yesterday, therefore, is a limited treaty which permits continued underground testing and prohibits only those tests that we ourselves can police. It requires no control posts, no onsite inspection, no international body.
We should also understand that it has other limits as well. Any nation which signs the treaty will have an opportunity to withdraw if it finds that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests; and no nation's right of self-defense will in any way be impaired. Nor does this treaty mean an end to the threat of nuclear war. It will not reduce nuclear stockpiles; it will not halt the production of nuclear weapons; it will not restrict their use in time of war.
Nevertheless, this limited treaty will radically reduce the nuclear testing which would otherwise be conducted on both sides; it will prohibit the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and all others who sign it, from engaging in the atmospheric tests which have so alarmed mankind; and it offers to all the world a welcome sign of hope.
For this is not a unilateral moratorium, but a specific and solemn legal obligation. While it will not prevent this Nation from testing underground, or from being ready to conduct atmospheric tests if the acts of others so require, it gives us a concrete opportunity to extend its coverage to other nations and later to other forms of nuclear tests.
This treaty is in part the product of Western patience and vigilance. We have made clear?most recently in Berlin and Cuba?our deep resolve to protect our security and our freedom against any form of aggression. We have also made clear our steadfast determination to limit the arms race. In three administrations, our soldiers and diplomats have worked together to this end, always supported by Great Britain. Prime Minister Macmillan joined with President Eisenhower in proposing a limited test ban in 1959, and again with me in 1961 and 1962.
But the achievement of this goal is not a victory for one side?it is a victory for mankind. It reflects no concessions either to or by the Soviet Union. It reflects simply our common recognition of the dangers in further testing.
This treaty is not the millennium. It will not resolve all conflicts, or cause the Communists to forego their ambitions, or eliminate the dangers of war. It will not reduce our need for arms or allies or programs of assistance to others. But it is an important first step?a step towards peace?a step towards reason?a step away from war.
Here is what this step can mean to you and to your children and your neighbors:
First, this treaty can be a step towards reduced world tension and broader areas of agreement. The Moscow talks have reached no agreement on any other subject, nor is this treaty conditioned on any other matter. Under Secretary Harriman made it clear that any nonaggression arrangements across the division in Europe would require full consultation with our allies and full attention to their interests. He also made clear our strong preference for a more comprehensive treaty banning all tests everywhere, and our ultimate hope for general and complete disarmament. The Soviet Government, however, is still unwilling to accept the inspection such goals require.
No one can predict with certainty, therefore, what further agreements, if any, can be built on the foundations of this one. They could include controls on preparations for surprise attack, or on numbers and type of armaments. There could be further limitations on the spread of nuclear weapons. The important point is that efforts to seek new agreements will go forward.
But the difficulty of predicting the next step is no reason to be reluctant about this step. Nuclear test ban negotiations have long been a symbol of East-West disagreement. If this treaty can also be a symbol?if it can symbolize the end of one era and the beginning of another?if both sides can by this treaty gain confidence and experience in peaceful collaboration?then this short and simple treaty may well become an historic mark in man's age-old pursuit of peace.
Western policies have long been designed to persuade the Soviet Union to renounce aggression, direct or indirect, so that their people and all people may live and let live in peace. The unlimited testing of new weapons of war cannot lead towards that end?but this treaty, if it can be followed by further progress, can clearly move in that direction.
I do not say that a world without aggression or threats of war would be an easy world. It will bring new problems, new challenges from the Communists, new dangers of relaxing our vigilance or of mistaking their intent.
But those dangers pale in comparison to those of the spiraling arms race and a collision course towards war. Since the beginning of history, war has been mankind's constant companion. It has been the rule, not the exception. Even a nation as young and as peace-loving as our own has fought through eight wars. And three times in the last two years and a half I have been required to report to you as President that this Nation and the Soviet Union stood on the verge of direct military confrontation?in Laos, in Berlin, and in Cuba.
A war today or tomorrow, if it led to nuclear war, would not be like any war in history. A full-scale nuclear exchange, lasting less than 60 minutes, with the weapons now in existence, could wipe out more than 300 million Americans, Europeans, and Russians, as well as untold numbers elsewhere. And the survivors, as Chairman Khrushchev warned the Communist Chinese, ""the survivors would envy the dead."" For they would inherit a world so devastated by explosions and poison and fire that today we cannot even conceive of its horrors. So let us try to turn the world away from war. Let us make the most of this opportunity, and every opportunity, to reduce tension, to slow down the perilous nuclear arms race, and to check the world's slide toward final annihilation.
Second, this treaty can be a step towards freeing the world from the fears and dangers of radioactive fallout. Our own atmospheric tests last year were conducted under conditions which restricted such fallout to an absolute minimum. But over the years the number and the yield of weapons tested have rapidly increased and so have the radioactive hazards from such testing. Continued unrestricted testing by the nuclear powers, joined in time by other nations which may be less adept in limiting pollution, will increasingly contaminate the air that all of us must breathe.
Even then, the number of children and grandchildren with cancer in their bones, with leukemia in their blood, or with poison in their lungs might seem statistically small to some, in comparison with natural health hazards. But this is not a natural health hazard?and it is not a statistical issue. The loss of even one human life, or the malformation of even one baby?who may be born long after we are gone?should be of concern to us all. Our children and grandchildren are not merely statistics toward which we can be indifferent.
Nor does this affect the nuclear powers alone. These tests befoul the air of all men and all nations, the committed and the uncommitted alike, without their knowledge and without their consent. That is why the continuation of atmospheric testing causes so many countries to regard all nuclear powers as equally evil; and we can hope that its prevention will enable those countries to see the world more clearly, while enabling all the world to breathe more easily.
Third, this treaty can be a step toward preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to nations not now possessing them. During the next several years, in addition to the four current nuclear powers, a small but significant number of nations will have the intellectual, physical, and financial resources to produce both nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them. In time, it is estimated, many other nations will have either this capacity or other ways of obtaining nuclear warheads, even as missiles can be commercially purchased today.
I ask you to stop and think for a moment what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands, in the hands of countries large and small, stable and unstable, responsible and irresponsible, scattered throughout the world. There would be no rest for anyone then, no stability, no real security, and no chance of effective disarmament. There would only be the increased chance of accidental war, and an increased necessity for the great powers to involve themselves in what otherwise would be local conflicts.
If only one thermonuclear bomb were to be dropped on any American, Russian, or any other city, whether it was launched by accident or design, by a madman or by an enemy, by a large nation or by a small, from any corner of the world, that one bomb could release more destructive power on the inhabitants of that one helpless city than all the bombs dropped in the Second World War.
Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union nor the United Kingdom nor France can look forward to that day with equanimity. We have a great obligation, all four nuclear powers have a great obligation, to use whatever time remains to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to persuade other countries not to test, transfer, acquire, possess, or produce such weapons.
This treaty can be the opening wedge in that campaign. It provides that none of the parties will assist other nations to test in the forbidden environments. It opens the door for further agreements on the control of nuclear weapons, and it is open for all nations to sign, for it is in the interest of all nations, and already we have heard from a number of countries who wish to join with us promptly.
Fourth and finally, this treaty can limit the nuclear arms race in ways which, on balance, will strengthen our Nation's security far more than the continuation of unrestricted testing. For in today's world, a nation's security does not always increase as its arms increase, when its adversary is doing the same, and unlimited competition in the testing and development of new types of destructive nuclear weapons will not make the world safer for either side. Under this limited treaty, on the other hand, the testing of other nations could never be sufficient to offset the ability of our strategic forces to deter or survive a nuclear attack and to penetrate and destroy an aggressor's homeland.
We have, and under this treaty we will continue to have, the nuclear strength that we need. It is true that the Soviets have tested nuclear weapons of a yield higher than that which we thought to be necessary, but the hundred megaton bomb of which they spoke 2 years ago does not and will not change the balance of strategic power. The United States has chosen, deliberately, to concentrate on more mobile and more efficient weapons, with lower but entirely sufficient yield, and our security is, therefore, not impaired by the treaty I am discussing.
It is also true, as Mr. Khrushchev would agree, that nations cannot afford in these matters to rely simply on the good faith of their adversaries. We have not, therefore, overlooked the risk of secret violations. There is at present a possibility that deep in outer space, that hundreds and thousands and millions of miles away from the earth illegal tests might go undetected. But we already have the capability to construct a system of observation that would make such tests almost impossible to conceal, and we can decide at any time whether such a system is needed in the light of the limited risk to us and the limited reward to others of violations attempted at that range. For any tests which might be conducted so far out in space, which cannot be conducted more easily and efficiently and legally underground, would necessarily be of such a magnitude that they would be extremely difficult to conceal. We can also employ new devices to check on the testing of smaller weapons in the lower atmosphere. Any violations, moreover, involves, along with the risk of detection, the end of the treaty and the worldwide consequences for the violator.
Secret violations are possible and secret preparations for a sudden withdrawal are possible, and thus our own vigilance and strength must be maintained, as we remain ready to withdraw and to resume all forms of testing, if we must. But it would be a mistake to assume that this treaty will be quickly broken. The gains of illegal testing are obviously slight compared to their cost, and the hazard of discovery, and the nations which have initialed and will sign this treaty prefer it, in my judgment, to unrestricted testing as a matter of their own self-interests for these nations, too, and all nations, have a stake in limiting the arms race, in holding the spread of nuclear weapons, and in breathing air that is not radioactive. While it may be theoretically possible to demonstrate the risks inherent in any treaty, and such risks in this treaty are small, the far greater risks to our security are the risks of unrestricted testing, the risk of a nuclear arms race, the risk of new nuclear powers, nuclear pollution, and nuclear war.
This limited test ban, in our most careful judgment, is safer by far for the United States than an unlimited nuclear arms race. For all these reasons, I am hopeful that this Nation will promptly approve the limited test ban treaty. There will, of course, be debate in the country and in the Senate. The Constitution wisely requires the advice and consent of the Senate to all treaties, and that consultation has already begun. All this is as it should be. A document which may mark an historic and constructive opportunity for the world deserves an historic and constructive debate.
It is my hope that all of you will take part in that debate, for this treaty is for all of us. It is particularly for our children and our grandchildren, and they have no lobby here in Washington. This debate will involve military, scientific, and political experts, but it must be not left to them alone. The right and the responsibility are yours.
If we are to open new doorways to peace, if we are to seize this rare opportunity for progress, if we are to be as bold and farsighted in our control of weapons as we have been in their invention, then let us now show all the world on this side of the wall and the other that a strong America also stands for peace. There is no cause for complacency.
We have learned in times past that the spirit of one moment or place can be gone in the next. We have been disappointed more than once, and we have no illusions now that there are shortcuts on the road to peace. At many points around the globe the Communists are continuing their efforts to exploit weakness and poverty. Their concentration of nuclear and conventional arms must still be deterred.
The familiar contest between choice and coercion, the familiar places of danger and conflict, are all still there, in Cuba, in Southeast Asia, in Berlin, and all around the globe, still requiring all the strength and the vigilance that we can muster. Nothing could more greatly damage our cause than if we and our allies were to believe that peace has already been achieved, and that our strength and unity were no longer required.
But now, for the first time in many years, the path of peace may be open. No one can be certain what the future will bring. No one can say whether the time has come for an easing of the struggle. But history and our own conscience will judge us harsher if we do not now make every effort to test our hopes by action, and this is the place to begin. According to the ancient Chinese proverb, ""A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.""
My fellow Americans, let us take that first step. Let us, if we can, step back from the shadows of war and seek out the way of peace. And if that journey is a thousand miles, or even more, let history record that we, in this land, at this time, took the first step.
Thank you and good night.",Persuasive
Inaugural Address,20-01-2017,Donald Trump,"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.

Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.

We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.

Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.

Today?s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another ? but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.

For too long, a small group in our nation?s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.

Washington flourished ? but the people did not share in its wealth.

Politicians prospered ? but the jobs left, and the factories closed.

The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.

Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation?s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.

That all changes ? starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.

It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. 

This is your day. This is your celebration.

And this, the United States of America, is your country.

What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.

January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. 

The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.

Everyone is listening to you now.

You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.

At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.

Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.

These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.

But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.

This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.

We are one nation ? and their pain is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.

The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.

For many decades, we?ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;

Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;

We've defended other nation?s borders while refusing to defend our own;

And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.

We?ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.

One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.

The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.

But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.

We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.

From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.

From this moment on, it?s going to be America First.

Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.

We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.

I will fight for you with every breath in my body ? and I will never, ever let you down.

America will start winning again, winning like never before.

We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back our wealth.  And we will bring back our dreams.

We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.

We will get our people off of welfare and back to work ? rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.

We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.

We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world ? but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.

We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.

We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones ? and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.

At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.

When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.

The Bible tells us, ?how good and pleasant it is when God?s people live together in unity.?

We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.

When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.

There should be no fear ? we are protected, and we will always be protected.

We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.

Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.

In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.

We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ? constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.

The time for empty talk is over.

Now arrives the hour of action.

Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.

We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.

We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.

A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.

It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.

And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.

So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:

You will never be ignored again.

Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Wealthy Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

Gettysburg Address,19-11-1863,Abraham Lincoln,"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate?we can not consecrate?we can not hallow?this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us?that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion?that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain?that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom?and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",Persuasive
Address to Congress,02-04-1917,Woodrow Wilson,"The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.

Just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.

?

It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us?however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.

We have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship?exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.

It is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts?for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.

To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Webster, Worcester and Bouvier all define a citizen to be a person in the United States, entitled to vote and hold office.

The only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no State has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities. Hence, every discrimination against women in the constitutions and laws of the several States is today null and void, precisely as in every one against Negroes.",Persuasive
Martial Law Units,04-06-1989,Deng Xiaoping,"This army still maintains the traditions of our old Red Army. What they crossed this time was in the true sense of the expression a political barrier, a threshold of life and death. This was not easy. This shows that the People?s Army is truly a great wall of iron and steel of the party and state. This shows that no matter how heavy our losses, the army, under the leadership of the party, will always remain the defender of the country, the defender of socialism, and the defender of the public interest. They are a most lovable people. At the same time, we should never forget how cruel our enemies are. We should have not one bit of forgiveness for them.

The fact that this incident broke out as it did is very worthy of our pondering. It prompts us cool-headedly to consider the past and the future. Perhaps this bad thing will enable us to go ahead with reform and the open policy at a steadier and better ? even a faster ? pace, more speedily correct our mistakes, and better develop our strong points",Persuasive

You?ve got to find what you love,12-06-2005,Steve Jobs,"I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I?ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That?s it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots.

I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: ?We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?? They said: ?Of course.? My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents? savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn?t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn?t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

It wasn?t all romantic. I didn?t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends? rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5 deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn?t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can?t capture, and I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it?s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.

Again, you can?t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something ? your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

My second story is about love and loss.

I was lucky ? I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents? garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation ? the Macintosh ? a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

I really didn?t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down ? that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me ? I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.

I didn?t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world?s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple?s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

I?m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn?t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don?t lose faith. I?m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You?ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven?t found it yet, keep looking. Don?t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you?ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don?t settle.

My third story is about death.

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: ?If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you?ll most certainly be right.? It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ?If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?? And whenever the answer has been ?No? for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I?ll be dead soon is the most important tool I?ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything ? all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure ? these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn?t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor?s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you?d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I?m fine now.

This was the closest I?ve been to facing death, and I hope it?s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don?t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life?s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

Your time is limited, so don?t waste it living someone else?s life. Don?t be trapped by dogma ? which is living with the results of other people?s thinking. Don?t let the noise of others? opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: ?Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.? It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

"The Fringe Benefits of Failure, and the Importance of Imagination",05-06-2008,J.K. Rowling,"President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, proud parents, and, above all, graduates.

The first thing I would like to say is ?thank you.? Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honour, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight. A win-win situation! Now all I have to do is take deep breaths, squint at the red banners and convince myself that I am at the world?s largest Gryffindor reunion.


Delivering a commencement address is a great responsibility; or so I thought until I cast my mind back to my own graduation. The commencement speaker that day was the distinguished British philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock. Reflecting on her speech has helped me enormously in writing this one, because it turns out that I can?t remember a single word she said. This liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business, the law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard.

You see? If all you remember in years to come is the ?gay wizard? joke, I?ve come out ahead of Baroness Mary Warnock. Achievable goals: the first step to self improvement.

Actually, I have wracked my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today. I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation, and what important lessons I have learned in the 21 years that have expired between that day and this.

I have come up with two answers. On this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success, I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure. And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called ?real life?, I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination.

These may seem quixotic or paradoxical choices, but please bear with me.

Looking back at the 21-year-old that I was at graduation, is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42-year-old that she has become. Half my lifetime ago, I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself, and what those closest to me expected of me.

At your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.

I am not dull enough to suppose that because you are young, gifted and well-educated, you have never known hardship or heartbreak. Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the Fates, and I do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment.

However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person?s idea of success, so high have you already flown.

Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.

Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution. I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time, any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality.

So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all ? in which case, you fail by default.

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.

So given a Time Turner, I would tell my 21-year-old self that personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a check-list of acquisition or achievement. Your qualifications, your CV, are not your life, though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two. Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone?s total control, and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes.

Now you might think that I chose my second theme, the importance of imagination, because of the part it played in rebuilding my life, but that is not wholly so. Though I personally will defend the value of bedtime stories to my last gasp, I have learned to value imagination in a much broader sense. Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared.

One of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter, though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books. This revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs. Though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours, I paid the rent in my early 20s by working at the African research department at Amnesty International?s headquarters in London.

There in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without trace, sent to Amnesty by their desperate families and friends. I read the testimony of torture victims and saw pictures of their injuries. I opened handwritten, eye-witness accounts of summary trials and executions, of kidnappings and rapes.

Many of my co-workers were ex-political prisoners, people who had been displaced from their homes, or fled into exile, because they had the temerity to speak against their governments. Visitors to our offices included those who had come to give information, or to try and find out what had happened to those they had left behind.

I shall never forget the African torture victim, a young man no older than I was at the time, who had become mentally ill after all he had endured in his homeland. He trembled uncontrollably as he spoke into a video camera about the brutality inflicted upon him. He was a foot taller than I was, and seemed as fragile as a child. I was given the job of escorting him back to the Underground Station afterwards, and this man whose life had been shattered by cruelty took my hand with exquisite courtesy, and wished me future happiness.

And as long as I live I shall remember walking along an empty corridor and suddenly hearing, from behind a closed door, a scream of pain and horror such as I have never heard since. The door opened, and the researcher poked out her head and told me to run and make a hot drink for the young man sitting with her. She had just had to give him the news that in retaliation for his own outspokenness against his country?s regime, his mother had been seized and executed.

Every day of my working week in my early 20s I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was, to live in a country with a democratically elected government, where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone.

Every day, I saw more evidence about the evils humankind will inflict on their fellow humans, to gain or maintain power. I began to have nightmares, literal nightmares, about some of the things I saw, heard, and read.

And yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before.

Amnesty mobilises thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have. The power of human empathy, leading to collective action, saves lives, and frees prisoners. Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet. My small participation in that process was one of the most humbling and inspiring experiences of my life.

Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people?s places.

Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral. One might use such an ability to manipulate, or control, just as much as to understand or sympathise.

And many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are. They can refuse to hear screams or to peer inside cages; they can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally; they can refuse to know.

I might be tempted to envy people who can live that way, except that I do not think they have any fewer nightmares than I do. Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental agoraphobia, and that brings its own terrors. I think the wilfully unimaginative see more monsters. They are often more afraid.

What is more, those who choose not to empathise enable real monsters. For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it, through our own apathy.

One of the many things I learned at the end of that Classics corridor down which I ventured at the age of 18, in search of something I could not then define, was this, written by the Greek author Plutarch: What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.

That is an astonishing statement and yet proven a thousand times every day of our lives. It expresses, in part, our inescapable connection with the outside world, the fact that we touch other people?s lives simply by existing.

But how much more are you, Harvard graduates of 2008, likely to touch other people?s lives? Your intelligence, your capacity for hard work, the education you have earned and received, give you unique status, and unique responsibilities. Even your nationality sets you apart. The great majority of you belong to the world?s only remaining superpower. The way you vote, the way you live, the way you protest, the pressure you bring to bear on your government, has an impact way beyond your borders. That is your privilege, and your burden.

If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful, but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence, but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped change. We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.

I am nearly finished. I have one last hope for you, which is something that I already had at 21. The friends with whom I sat on graduation day have been my friends for life. They are my children?s godparents, the people to whom I?ve been able to turn in times of trouble, people who have been kind enough not to sue me when I took their names for Death Eaters. At our graduation we were bound by enormous affection, by our shared experience of a time that could never come again, and, of course, by the knowledge that we held certain photographic evidence that would be exceptionally valuable if any of us ran for Prime Minister.

So today, I wish you nothing better than similar friendships. And tomorrow, I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine, you remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of ancient wisdom:
As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.
I wish you all very good lives.
Thank-you very much.

I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension. I know that the irony strikes with the force of a cartoon anvil, now.

So they hoped that I would take a vocational degree; I wanted to study English Literature. A compromise was reached that in retrospect satisfied nobody, and I went up to study Modern Languages. Hardly had my parents? car rounded the corner at the end of the road than I ditched German and scuttled off down the Classics corridor.

I cannot remember telling my parents that I was studying Classics; they might well have found out for the first time on graduation day. Of all the subjects on this planet, I think they would have been hard put to name one less useful than Greek mythology when it came to securing the keys to an executive bathroom.

I would like to make it clear, in parenthesis, that I do not blame my parents for their point of view. There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you. What is more, I cannot criticise my parents for hoping that I would never experience poverty. They had been poor themselves, and I have since been poor, and I quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience. Poverty entails fear, and stress, and sometimes depression; it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships. Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is indeed something on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticised only by fools.

What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.",Persuasive

Commencement Speech Transcript 2014 at Maharishi University of Management,30-05-2014,Jim Carrey,"Thank you. What are you sitting down for? I was going to milk that for a while. You guys can stretch that out in post, right? Can make that longer in the edit. Thank you, Bevin. Thank you all.

I brought one of my paintings to show you today. I hope you guys are going to be able to see it okay. It?s not one of my bigger pieces. So you might want to move down front. Get a good look at it. Faculty, parents, friends, dignified guests, graduating class of 2014, and all the dead baseball players coming out of the corn to be with us today. After the harvest, there?s no place for them to hide. Fields are empty. There?s no cover there. I?m here to plant a seed today. A seed that will inspire you to move forward in life with enthusiastic hearts and a clear sense of wholeness. The question is will that seed have a chance to take root or will I be sued by Monsanto and forced to use their seed, which may not be totally Ayurvedic?

Excuse me if I seem a little bit low energy tonight, today, whatever this is, I slept with my head to the north last night. Oh man. Oh man. You know how that is, right kids? Yeah. Woke up right in the middle of Pitta, couldn?t get back to sleep until Vata rolled around. Crazy. But I didn?t freak out. I used that time to eat a large meal, connect with someone special on Tinder. Because life doesn?t happen to you. It happens for you. How do I know this? I don?t, but I?m making sound and that?s the important thing. That?s what I?m here to do.

Sometimes I think that?s the only thing that?s important really, is just letting each other know we?re here. Reminding each other that we?re part of a larger self. I used to think Jim Carrey is all that I was. Just a flickering light, a dancing shadow. The great nothing masquerading as something you can name, seeking shelter in caves and foxholes dug out hastily. An archer searching for his target in the mirror, wounded only by my own arrows. Begging to be enslaved, leading for my chains. Blinded by longing and tripping over paradise.

Can I get an amen? You didn?t think I could be serious, did you? I don?t think you understand who you?re dealing with. I have no limits. I cannot be contained because I?m the container. You can?t contain the container, man. You can?t contain the container. I used to believe that who I was ended at the edge of my skin, that I had been given this little vehicle called a body from which to experience creation. And though I couldn?t have asked for a sportier model, it was after all a loner and would have to be returned. Then I learned that everything outside the vehicle was part of me too, and now I drive a convertible. Top down, wind in my hair.

I am elated and truly, truly, truly excited to be present and fully connected to you at this important moment in your journey. I hope you?re ready to open the roof and take it all in. Okay. Four more years then. They?re obviously not ready. Just needs some more

I want to thank the trustees, the administrators, the faculty of MUM for creating an institution worthy of Maharishi?s ideals of education. A place that teaches knowledge and experience, the knowledge and experience necessary to be productive in life, as well as enabling the students through transcendental meditation and ancient Vedic knowledge to slack off twice a day for an hour and a half. Don?t think you?re fooling me. But I guess it has some benefits. It does allow you to separate who you truly are. And what?s real from the stories that run through your head. You have given them the ability to walk behind the mind?s elaborate set decoration and to see that there?s a huge difference between a dog that is going to eat you in your mind and an actual dog that is going to eat you.

That may sound like no big deal, but many never learned that distinction. And they spend a great deal of their lives living in fight or flight response. I?d like to acknowledge all of you wonderful parents. Way to go. What a fantastic job you?ve done. For your tireless dedication, your love, your support, most of all for the attention that you paid to your children. I have a saying, be aware the unloved because they will eventually hurt themselves or me. But when I look at this group here, I feel really safe. I do. I?m just going to say it. My room is not locked. My room is not locked. No doubt some of you will turn out to be crooks, but white collar stuff. You know, Wall Street, that type of thing. Crimes committed by people with self-esteem. Stuff parents can still be proud of in a weird way.

And to the graduating class of 2017? Minus three. You didn?t let me finish. Congratulations. Yes. Give yourself a round of applause please. You are the vanguard of knowledge and consciousness, a new wave in a vast ocean of possibilities. On the other side of that door, there?s a world starving for new ideas, new leadership. I?ve been out there for 30 years. She?s a wild cat. She?ll rub up against your leg and purr until you pick her up and start petting her. And then out of nowhere, she?ll swat you in the face. It can be rough out there, but that?s okay because there?s soft serve ice cream with sprinkles.

I guess that?s what I?m really trying to say here today. Sometimes it?s okay to eat your feelings. Now fear is going to be a player in your life, but you get to decide how much. You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about the pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what?s happening here, and the decisions we make in this moment, which are based in either love or fear. So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect. So we never dare to ask the universe for it. I?m saying I?m the proof that you can ask the universe for it. Please. And if it doesn?t happen for you right away, it?s only because the universe is so busy fulfilling my order. Party size.

My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn?t believe that that was possible for him. And so he made a conservative choice. Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant. And when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job and our family had to do whatever we could to survive. I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don?t want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.

It?s not the only thing he taught me though. I watched the effect of my father?s love and humor and how it altered the world around me, and I thought, ?That?s something to do. That?s something worth my time.? It wasn?t long before I started acting up. People would come over to the house and they?d be greeted by a seven year old, throwing himself down a large flight of stairs. They would say, ?What happened?? And I would say, ?I don?t know, let?s check the replay.? I?d go back to the top of the stairs and come back down in slow motion. It was a very strange household.

My father used to brag that I wasn?t a ham, I was the whole pig. And he treated my talent as if it was his second chance. When I was about 28, after a decade as a professional comedian, I realized one night in LA that the purpose of my life had always been to free people from concern, just like my dad. And when I realized this, I dubbed my new devotion the Church of Freedom From Concern, the Church of FFC. And I dedicated myself to that ministry. What?s yours? How will you serve the world? What did they need that your talent can provide? That?s all you have to figure out.

As someone who?s done what you?re about to go and do, I can tell you from experience the effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is. Because everything you gain in life will rot and fall apart, and all that will be left of you is what was in your heart. My choosing to free people, my choosing to free people from concern got me to the top of a mountain. Look where I am, look what I get to do? Everywhere I go? I?m going to get emotional because when I tap into this, it really is extraordinary to me. I did something that made people present their best selves to me, wherever I go.

I am the top of the mountain, and I was. And the only one I hadn?t freed was myself, and that?s when my search for identity deepened. I wondered who I?d be without my fame. Who would I be if I said things that people didn?t want to hear, or if I defied their expectations of me? What if I showed up to the party without my Mardi Gras mask and refused to flash my breasts for a handful of beans? I?ll give you a moment to wipe that image out of your mind. You guys are so ahead of the game. You already know who you are.

And that peace, that peace that we?re after lies somewhere beyond personality, beyond the perception of others, beyond invention and disguise. Even beyond effort itself. You can join the game, fight the wars, play with form all you want, but to find real peace you have to let the armor go. Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world. Don?t let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form. Risk being seen in all of your glory.

It?s not big enough. This painting is big for a reason. It?s called High Visibility. It?s about picking up the light and daring to be seen. Here?s the tricky part. Everyone is attracted to the light. The party host up at the top, who thinks unconsciousness is bliss and is always offering to drink from the bottles that empty you. Misery, below her, despises the light, can?t stand when you?re doing well, wishes you nothing but the worst. The Queen of Diamonds, under him, needs a King to build her house of cards. And the hollow one down bottom there will clean to your leg and say, ?Please don?t leave me behind for I have abandoned myself.?

Even those who are closest to you and most in love with you, the people you love most in the world will find clarity confronting at times. This painting took me thousands of hours to complete. And when I was finished? Thank you, thousands of hours, yes. I?ll never get them back. I?ll never get them back. I worked on this for so long. I was weeks and weeks like a madman alone on a scaffolding. And when I was finished, one of my friends said this would be a cool black light painting. So I started over.

Welcome to Burning Man. Some pretty crazy characters up there, but better up there than in here. Painting is one of the ways? Thank you. Painting is one of the ways I free myself from concern. A way to stop the world through total mental, spiritual, and physical involvement. But even with that comes a feeling of divine dissatisfaction, because ultimately we?re not the avatars we create. We?re not the pictures on the film stock. We are the light that shines through. All else is just smoke and mirrors, distracting but not truly compelling. I?ve often said that I wish people could realize all their dreams and wealth and fame so that they could see that it?s not where you?re going to find your sense of completion.

Like many of you, I was concerned about going out into the world and doing something bigger than myself, until someone smarter than myself made me realize that there is nothing bigger than myself. My soul is not contained within the limits of my body. My body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul. One unified field. One unified field of nothing dancing for no particular reason, except maybe to comfort and entertain itself.

As that shift happens in you, you won?t be feeling the world, you?ll be felt by it. You?ll be embraced by it. Now I?m always at the beginning, I have a reset button and I ride that button constantly. Once that button is functioning in your life, there?s no story that the mind could create that will be as compelling. The imagination is always manufacturing scenarios, both good and bad. And the ego tries to keep you trapped in the multiplex of the mind. Our eyes are not viewers. They?re also projectors that are running a second story over the picture that we see in front of us all the time. Fear is writing that script, and the working title is I?ll Never be Enough.

And you?re going to look at a person like me and say, ?How could we ever hope to reach those kinds of heights, Jim?? How can we make a painting that?s too big for our home? How do you fly so high without a special breathing apparatus? This is the voice of the ego. And if you listen to it, there will always be someone who?s doing better than you. No matter what you gain, ego will not let you rest. He will tell you that you cannot stop until you?ve left an indelible mark on the earth, until you?ve achieved immortality. How tricky is this ego that it would tempt us with a promise of something we already possess? So I just want you to relax. That?s my job. Relax and dream up a good life.

I had a substitute teacher from Ireland in the second grade that told my class during morning prayer that when she wants something, anything at all, she prays for it and promises something in return. And she always gets what she wants. I?m sitting at the back of the classroom thinking, ?Wow, my family can?t afford a bike.? So I went home and I prayed for one and I promised I would recite the rosary every night in exchange. Broke it. Broke that promise. But two weeks later, I got home from school to find a brand new Mustang bike with a banana seat and easy rider handlebars. Yeah. From fool to cool.

My family informed me that I had won the bike in a raffle that a friend of mine had entered my name in without my knowledge whatsoever. So that type of thing has been happening to me ever since. As far as I can tell, it?s just about letting the universe know what you want and working toward it while letting go of how it comes to pass.

Your job is not to figure out how it?s going to happen for you, but to open the door in your head. And when the door opens in real life, just walk through it. And don?t worry if you miss your cue because there?s always doors opening. They keep opening. And when I say, ?Life doesn?t happen to you, it happens for you.? I really don?t know if that?s true. I?m just making a conscious choice to perceive challenges as something beneficial so that I can deal with them in the most productive way. You?ll come up with your own style. That?s part of the fun.

Oh, and why not take a chance on faith as well? Take a chance on faith, not religion, but faith. Not hope, but faith. I don?t believe in hope. Hope is a beggar. Hope walks through the fire and faith leaps over it. You are ready and able to do beautiful things in this world. And after you walk through those doors today, you will only ever have two choices, love or fear. Choose love, and don?t ever let fear turn you against your playful heart.

Thank you so much.. I?m so honored. Thank you.",Persuasive
Ellen DeGeneres? Commencement Address at Tulane University,22-05-2016,Ellen DeGeneres,"Oh boy, thank you so much, thank you so much. Thank you, President Cowan, Mrs. President Cowen; distinguished guests, undistinguished guests, you know who you are, honored faculty and creepy Spanish teacher. And thank you to all the graduating Class of 2009, I realize most of you are hungover and have splitting headaches and haven?t slept since Fat Tuesday, but you can?t graduate ?til I finish, so listen up.

When I was asked to make the commencement speech, I immediately said yes. Then I went to look up what commencement meant which would have been easy if I had a dictionary, but most of the books in our house are Portia?s, and they?re all written in Australian. So I had to break the word down myself, to find out the meaning.

Commencement: common, and cement, common cement. You commonly see cement on sidewalks. Sidewalks have cracks, and if you step on a crack, you break your mother?s back. So there?s that. But I?m honored that you?ve asked me here to speak at your common cement.

I thought that you had to be a famous alumnus, alumini, aluminum, alumis; you had to graduate from this school. And I didn?t go to college here, and I don?t know if President Cowan knows, I didn?t go to any college at all, any college. And I?m not saying you wasted your time, or money, but look at me, I?m a huge celebrity.

Although I did graduate from the school of hard knocks, our mascot was the knockers. I spent a lot of time here growing up. My mom worked at Newcomb and I would go there every time I needed to steal something out of her purse.

But why am I here today? Clearly not to steal, you?re too far away and I?d never get away with it. I?m here because of you. Because I can?t think of a more tenacious, more courageous graduating class. I mean, look at you all, wearing your robes. Usually when you?re wearing a robe at 10 in the morning, it means you?ve given up.

I?m here because I love New Orleans. I was born and raised here, I spent my formative years here, and like you, while I was living here I only did laundry six times. When I finished school, I was completely lost and by school, I mean middle school, but I went ahead and finished high school anyway. And I really, I had no ambition; I didn?t know what I wanted to do. I did everything from: I shucked oysters, I was a hostess, I was a bartender, I was a waitress, I painted houses, I sold vacuum cleaners; I had no idea and I thought I?d just finally settle in some job and I would make enough money to pay my rent, maybe have basic cable, maybe not, I didn?t really have a plan.

My point is that, by the time I was your age, I really thought I knew who I was but I had no idea. Like for example, when I was your age, I was dating men. So what I?m saying is, when you?re older, most of you will be gay. Is anybody writing this stuff down? Parents?

Anyway, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and the way I ended up on this path was from a very tragic event. I was maybe 19, and my girlfriend at the time was killed in a car accident. And I passed the accident, and I didn?t know it was her and I kept going and I found out shortly after that, it was her.

And I was living in a basement apartment; I had no money; I had no heat, no air, I had a mattress on the floor and the apartment was infested with fleas. And I was soul-searching, I was like, why is she suddenly gone, and there are fleas here? I don?t understand, there must be a purpose and wouldn?t it be so convenient if we could pick up the phone and call God and ask these questions.

And I started writing and what poured out of me was an imaginary conversation with God, which was one-sided and I finished writing it and I looked at it and I said to myself, and I hadn?t even been doing stand-up, ever, there was no club in town. I said, ?I?m going do this on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson? at the time he was the king ?and I?m going be the first woman in the history of the show to be called over to sit down.? and several years later, I was the first woman in the history of the show, and only woman in the history of the show to sit down, because of that phone conversation with God that I wrote.

And I started this path of stand-up and it was successful and it was great but it was hard because I was trying to please everybody and I had this secret that I was keeping, that I was gay. And I thought if people found out they wouldn?t like me, they wouldn?t laugh at me. Then my career turned into, I got my own sitcom, and that was very successful, another level of success. And I thought, what if they find out I?m gay, then they?ll never watch, and this was a long time ago, this was when we just had white presidents. But anyway, this was back many years ago.

And I finally decided that I was living with so much shame, and so much fear, that I just couldn?t live that way anymore and I decided to come out and make it creative. And my character would come out at the same time, and it wasn?t to make a political statement, it wasn?t to do anything other than to free myself up from this heaviness that I was carrying around, and I just wanted to be honest. And I thought, ?What?s the worst that could happen? I can lose my career?. I did. I lost my career. The show was cancelled after six years without even telling me; I read it in the paper. The phone didn?t ring for three years. I had no offers. Nobody wanted to touch me at all.

Yet, I was getting letters from kids that almost committed suicide, but didn?t because of what I did. And I realized that I had a purpose. And it wasn?t just about me and it wasn?t about celebrity, but I felt like I was being punished and it was a bad time, I was angry, I was sad, and then I was offered a talk show. And the people that offered me the talk show tried to sell it. And most stations didn?t want to pick it up. Most people didn?t want to buy it because they thought nobody would watch me.

Really when I look back on it, I wouldn?t change a thing. I mean, it was so important for me to lose everything because I found out what the most important thing is, is to be true to yourself. Ultimately, that?s what?s gotten me to this place. I don?t live in fear, I?m free; I have no secrets and I know I?ll always be OK, because no matter what, I know who I am.

So In conclusion, when I was younger I thought success was something different. I thought when I grow up, I want to be famous. I want to be a star. I want to be in movies. When I grow up I want to see the world, drive nice cars, I want to have groupies. To quote the Pussycat Dolls. How many people thought it was ?boobies?, by the way? It?s not, it?s ?groupies?.

But my idea of success is different today. And as you grow, you?ll realize the definition of success changes. For many of you, today, success is being able to hold down 20 shots of tequila. For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not to give into peer pressure to try to be something that you?re not, to live your life as an honest and compassionate person, to contribute in some way. So to conclude my conclusion, follow your passion, stay true to yourself. Never follow anyone else?s path, unless you?re in the woods and you?re lost and you see a path and by all means you should follow that.

Don?t give advice, it will come back and bite you in the ass. Don?t take anyone?s advice. So my advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine. And I know that a lot of you are concerned about your future, but there?s no need to worry. The economy is booming, the job market is wide open, the planet is just fine. It?s going be great.

You?ve already survived a hurricane. What else can happen to you? And as I mentioned before, some of the most devastating things that happen to you will teach you the most. And now you know the right questions to ask in your first job interview. Like, ?Is it above sea level??

So to conclude my conclusion that I?ve previously concluded, in the common cement speech, I guess what I?m trying to say is life is like one big Mardi Gras. But instead of showing your boobs, show people your brain, and if they like what they see, you?ll have more beads than you know what to do with and you?ll be drunk, most of the time.

So the Katrina class of 2009, I say congratulations and if you don?t remember a thing I said today, remember this, you?re going to be OK, dum de dumdumdum, just dance.",Persuasive
Tryst with Destiny,14-07-1947,Jawaharlal Nehru,"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our
pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour,
when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but
rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of
a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment, we take the
pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.
At the dawn of history, India started on her unending quest, and trackless centuries are filled with
her striving and grandeur of her success and failures. Through good and ill fortune alike, she has
never lost sight of that quest, forgotten the ideals which gave her strength. We end today a period of
misfortunes and India discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an
opening of opportunity to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us. Are we brave
enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?
Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility rests upon this Assembly, a sovereign
body representing the sovereign people of India. Before the birth of freedom, we have endured all
the pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of this sorrrow. Some of those pains
continue even now. Nevertheless, the past is over and it is the future that beckons us now.
That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving so that we may fulfill the pledges
we have so often taken and the one we shall take today. The service of India means, the service of
the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and poverty and disease and
inequality of opportunity. The ambition of the greatest men of our generation has been to wipe
every tear from every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears and suffering, so
long our work will not be over.
And so we have to labour and to work, and to work hard, to give reality to our dreams. Those
dreams are for India, but they are also for the world, for all the nations and peoples are too closely
knit together today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart. Peace is said to be
indivisible, so is freedom, so is prosperity now, and also is disaster in this one world that can no
longer be split into isolated fragments.
To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an appeal to join us with faith and
confidence in this great adventure. This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for illwill or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may
dwell.
The appointed day has come -the day appointed by destiny- and India stands forth again, after long
slumber and struggle, awake, vital, free and independent. The past clings on to us still in some
measure and we have to do much before we redeem the pledges we have so often taken. ",Ceremonial
Dandi March Speech,11-03-1930,Mahatma Gandhi,"In all probability this will be my last speech to you. Even if the Government allow me to march tomorrow morning, this will be my last speech on the sacred banks of the Sabarmati. Possibly these may be the last words of my life here.

I have already told you yesterday what I had to say. Today I shall confine myself to what you should do after my companions and I are arrested. The programme of the march to Jalalpur must be fulfilled as originally settled. The enlistment of the volunteers for this purpose should be confined to Gujarat only. From what I have been and heard during the last fortnight, I am inclined to believe that the stream of civil resisters will flow unbroken.

But let there be not a semblance of breach of peace even after all of us have been arrested. We have resolved to utilize all our resources in the pursuit of an exclusively nonviolent struggle. Let no one commit a wrong in anger. This is my hope and prayer. I wish these words of mine reached every nook and corner of the land. My task shall be done if I perish and so do my comrades. It will then be for the Working Committee of the Congress to show you the way and it will be up to you to follow its lead. So long as I have reached Jalalpur, let nothing be done in contravention to the authority vested in me by the Congress. But once I am arrested, the whole responsibility shifts to the Congress. No one who believes in non-violence, as a creed, need, therefore, sit still. My compact with the Congress ends as soon as I am arrested. In that case volunteers. Wherever possible, civil disobedience of salt should be started. These laws can be violated in three ways. It is an offence to manufacture salt wherever there are facilities for doing so. The possession and sale of contraband salt, which includes natural salt or salt earth, is also an offence. The purchasers of such salt will be equally guilty. To carry away the natural salt deposits on the seashore is likewise violation of law. So is the hawking of such salt. In short, you may choose any one or all of these devices to break the salt monopoly.

We are, however, not to be content with this alone. There is no ban by the Congress and wherever the local workers have self-confidence other suitable measures may be adopted. I stress only one condition, namely, let our pledge of truth and nonviolence as the only means for the attainment of Swaraj be faithfully kept. For the rest, every one has a free hand. But, than does not give a license to all and sundry to carry on their own responsibility. Wherever there are local leaders, their orders should be obeyed by the people. Where there are no leaders and only a handful of men have faith in the programme, they may do what they can, if they have enough self-confidence. They have a right, nay it is their duty, to do so. The history of the is full of instances of men who rose to leadership, by sheer force of self-confidence, bravery and tenacity. We too, if we sincerely aspire to Swaraj and are impatient to attain it, should have similar self-confidence. Our ranks will swell and our hearts strengthen, as the number of our arrests by the Government increases.

Much can be done in many other ways besides these. The Liquor and foreign cloth shops can be picketed. We can refuse to pay taxes if we have the requisite strength. The lawyers can give up practice. The public can boycott the law courts by refraining from litigation. Government servants can resign their posts. In the midst of the despair reigning all round people quake with fear of losing employment. Such men are unfit for Swaraj. But why this despair? The number of Government servants in the country does not exceed a few hundred thousands. What about the rest? Where are they to go? Even free India will not be able to accommodate a greater number of public servants. A Collector then will not need the number of servants, he has got today. He will be his own servant. Our starving millions can by no means afford this enormous expenditure. If, therefore, we are sensible enough, let us bid good-bye to Government employment, no matter if it is the post of a judge or a peon. Let all who are co-operating with the Government in one way or another, be it by paying taxes, keeping titles, or sending children to official schools, etc. withdraw their co-operation in all or as many watts as possible. Then there are women who can stand shoulder to shoulder with men in this struggle.

You may take it as my will. It was the message that I desired to impart to you before starting on the march or for the jail. I wish that there should be no suspension or abandonment of the war that commences tomorrow morning or earlier, if I am arrested before that time. I shall eagerly await the news that ten batches are ready as soon as my batch is arrested. I believe there are men in India to complete the work our begun by me. I have faith in the righteousness of our cause and the purity of our weapons. And where the means are clean, there God is undoubtedly present with His blessings. And where these three combine, there defeat is an impossibility. A Satyagrahi, whether free or incarcerated, is ever victorious. He is vanquished only, when he forsakes truth and nonviolence and turns a deaf ear to the inner voice. If, therefore, there is such a thing as defeat for even a Satyagrahi, he alone is the cause of it. God bless you all and keep off all obstacles from the path in the struggle that begins tomorrow.",Ceremonial
First anniversary of the formation of the Home Rule League,01-04-1917,Bal Gangadhar Tilak,"I am young in spirit though old in body. I do not wish to lose this privilege of youth. To deny the growing capacity to my thinking power is to admit that I have no right to speak on this resolution. Whatever I am going to speak today is eternally young. The body might grow old, decrepit and it might perish, but the soul is immortal. Similarly, if there might be an apparent lull in our Home Rule activities, the freedom of the spirit behind it is eternal and indestructible, and it will secure liberty for us.

The Soul means Parameshwar and the mind will not get peace till it gets identified with Him. If one body is worn out the soul will take another: so assures the Gita. This philosophy is quite old. Freedom is my birthright. So long as it is awake within me, I am not old. No weapon can cut this spirit, no fire can burn it, no water can wet it, no wind can dry it. I say further that no CID can burn it. I declare the same principle to the Superintendent of Police who is sitting before me, to the Collector who had been invited to attend this meeting and to the Government shorthand writer who is busy taking down notes of our speeches.

This principle will not disappear even if it seems to be killed. We ask for Home Rule and we must get it. The Science which ends in Home Rule is the Science of Politics and not the one which ends in slavery. The Science of Politics is the ""Vedas"" of the country. You have a soul and I only want to wake it up. I want to tear off the blind that has been let down by ignorant, designing and selfish people. The Science of Politics consists of two parts. The first is Divine and the second is Demonic. The slavery of a Nation comes into the latter part. There cannot be a moral justification for the Demonic part of the Science of Politics. A Nation which might justify this is guilty of sin in the sight of God. Some people have the courage to declare what is harmful to them and some have not that courage. The political and religious teaching consists in giving the knowledge of this principle. Religious and political teachings are not separate, though they appear to be so on account of foreign rule. All philosophies are included in the Science of Politics.

Who does not know the meaning of Home Rule? Who does not want it? Would you like it, if I enter your house and take possession of your cooking department? I must have the right to manage the affairs in my own house. It is only lunatics and children who do not know how to manage their own affairs.

The cardinal creed of the conferences is that a member must be above 21 years of age; do you not, therefore, think that you want your own rights? Not being lunatics or children you uuderstand your own business, your own rights and, therefore, you know Home Rule. We are told we are not fit for Home Rule. A century has passed away and the British Rule has not made us fit for Home Rule; now we will make our own efforts and fit ourselves for it.

To offer irrelevant excuses, to hold out any temptation and to make other offers will be putting a stigma on the English policy. England is trying to protect the small state of Belgium with the help of India; how can it then say that we should not have Home Rule? Those who find fault with us are avaricious people. But there are people who find fault even with the All-Merciful God. We must work hard to save the soul of our Nation without caring for anything. The good of our country consists in guarding this - our birthright. The Congress has passed this Home Rule resolution. The Provincial Conference is only a child of the Congress, which submits to mandates of its father. We will follow Shri Ramachandra in obeying the order of our father the Congress. We are determined to make efforts to get this resolution enforced even if the effort leads us to the desert, compels us to live incognito, makes us suffer any hardship and even if it finally brings us to death. Shri Ramachandra did it. Do not pass this resolution by merely clapping your hands but by taking a solemn vow that you will work for it. We will work for it by every possible constitutional and law-abiding method to get Home Rule.

Through the grace of God, England has changed its mind towards us. We feel our efforts will not be without success. England proudly thought that a tiny nation might be able to protect the Empire by itself. This pride has gone down. England has now begun to feel that it must make changes in the constitution of the Empire. Lloyd George has openly confessed that England cannot go on without the help of India. All notions about a Nation of a thousand years old have to be changed. The English people have discovered that the wisdom of all their parties is not sufficient. The Indian soldiers have saved the lives of the British soldiers on the French battlefield and have showed their bravery. Those who once considered us as slaves have begun now to call us brothers. God has brought about all these changes. We must push our demands while the notion of this brotherhood is existing in the minds of the English. We must inform them that we, thirty crores of the Indian people, are ready to lay down our lives for the Empire; and that while we are with them none shall dare cast an evil glance at the Empire.",Ceremonial
Africa and Its Position in the World Today,06-04-2000,Nelson Mandela,"Ladies and gentlemen. Forgive me if I am somewhat nervous. I come, as you know from the colonies! We are not used to being in the presence of such an august gathering.



I grew up in the Eastern Cape, an area of South Africa much like the one so well described to you by Thomas Hardy. It was a world of oral tradition, healing properties were herbal, an abscess would be treated with poultices, clean water was simply not available. Gastro intestinal infections, malaria, cholera were rampant. Life was brutish and short. Electricity and the horseless carriage did not exist for me. The hardness and poverty of existence was aggravated by an uncaring society. Colonies were meant to be exploited both for the mother country and for those who came to settle in our area. Fresh in the memories of the older generation of the poorest of the very poor, and spoken of in low hushed tones, what was said to be a hugely profitable business that was said to have been abolished ? that was the business of slavery. My youth and young adulthood was spent with others in fighting an unjust and oppressive system.

Many African leaders today would say exactly the same thing. And when you assess the achievements and failures of Africa you must always keep this background in mind. One of the greatest mistakes which is made by serious political commentators today is to judge us on the same basis by which you judge opinion makers in the old and advanced industrial countries, forgetting that for more than three centuries our people were denied the privileges which you take for granted.

You went to the best schools in the country ? well equipped with highly qualified educators; classrooms properly equipped with learning aids; where the language at school was identical to the language at home; with parents with a high level of educational accomplishment, who could help their children to grasp sophisticated concepts at an early age.

But when you consider the situation of the blacks in Africa you come across a different state of affairs. Children who go to school without any learning aids. Taught in a language which is not theirs, by teachers often not so very qualified. A child comes back from school normally to parents who have no educational background at all. Poor children eating porridge in the morning, porridge at lunch, porridge as their dinner, unable to concentrate. Large families with little room to move about. A child who shares a room with about three or four others. No table, no chairs. Doing their homework on the floor.

These are the people who live in Africa today and I hope that when you make your assessment you will bear in mind this background. The people who run the governments in Africa today are people who were never given any opportunity to train in government, as many of you are. And I have no doubt that you will bear this in mind, not only in our discussions here but when examining the whole situation in Africa.

Being a former head of state has its advantages. One of them is having the time to speak in institutions where young people must listen while their elders pose difficult questions. I trust that my honorary membership of the student unions of a number of London University colleges, including LSE, will not mean that I have to try and provide answers myself! Nor that I will be examined on what I say. One shares one?s thoughts with every confidence at a university with a proud record of solidarity with the struggles of oppressed people, and which is also renowned world-wide, as a centre of learning and enquiry.

LSE, as part of the University of London, was in the vanguard of the great army of men and women across the world who responded to the call to isolate the apartheid regime. They insisted that human rights are the rights of all people everywhere. I feel greatly honoured to have an honorary degree from the University of London. Today brings an opportunity to thank LSE in person and with all humility for the part it played in that tribute to the South African people for their achievement in turning from conflict to the peaceful pursuit of a better life for all.

For many South Africans, LSE also meant the opportunity for learning that apartheid denied them in their own country. Those who were students are now working in all sectors of our society, leaders of a nation, leading a bright and common future. We continue to draw upon you for training and knowledge in fields that are critical to the development of our country. May your practical solidarity and our partnership long continue. Your invitation to me to reflect with you on the challenges facing Africa speaks of your continuing commitment to our shared goals and I thank you most sincerely.

A difficult question I wish to pose today is simply this: What historical stage is Africa going through? As is generally the case with questions of history and development, an adequate answer will require years of work by African historians and social scientists in partnership with institutions like yours.

This is especially so, given the rapid and far-reaching changes affecting the world as a whole. And it is quite likely that future historians will not see this period in quite the same way as we who are living through it. So I will exercise that privilege I refer to, and not try to answer the question, other than to say this: we are convinced that we are in a period of decisive historical significance for Africa and its place in the world. We are determined that this 21st century shall indeed be the African century.

Matching the scale of what we are seeking to bring about, our challenges are formulated in terms that may evoke periods of major historical change in other regions of the world in other times. Thus, the idea of an African renaissance has taken hold in our continent with all the resonance of an idea whose time has come. The rebirth we are engaged in is not one that will culminate, as European renaissance did, in colonisation and dominance of a world economic system, of which the slave trade was an integral part. Ours is, however, a rebirth that must deal with problems that derive from Africa?s historical relation with the rest of the world, established in that period. And this must be achieved in a rapidly globalising world. A second historical project, related to the first, is that of building strong institutions in a united continent. Political, economic and social institutions at national, regional and continental level.

The weak states that are also part of our historical legacy are amongst the conditions which all too easily allow war lordism to emerge, ethnic mobilisation to divide a united people into warring forces, and the resulting tensions and conflicts to threaten regions with instability.

Again, this process of building strong states and institutions cannot pass through the horrific destruction and slaughter that Europe inflicted upon itself before it achieved that goal, above all in the first half of the 20th century. On the other hand, the system of multilateral and international institutions, that were established in the middle of the 20th century to ensure that such catastrophes do not happen again will provide an important part of the armoury of weapons for building an equitable world.

This remains true, even as we seek to reform our international organisations so that they reflect in practise the democratic principles of a de-colonised world.

The vision expressed in the idea of African renaissance is that of the reconstruction and development of an Africa in which people?s lives are constantly and rapidly improving towards standards broadly in line with the best in the world.

It is also a vision of an Africa that is integrated in the world on an equal basis. Africa collectively stands at the bottom of the world stage of development ? completely. This means for millions the ills brought by poverty and under-development, the scourges of disease such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV Aids, and educational programmes that are far from what is needed for Africa?s full participation in the modern economy and society. As the world is seeing now in what the floods are doing to the people of Mozambique and part of South Africa, it means a vulnerability to environmental disaster.

If, despite all this, we talk with conviction of realising our long-cherished dream, of rebirth and reconstruction it is because the conditions for doing so now exist. They include the stage of development of the world?s economy. While this brings the danger that historical imbalances may be entrenched and even worsened, it also brings opportunities for Africa as a region of vast untapped potential. The conditions improved at the liberation of South Africa as the culmination of Africa?s struggle against colonial and white minority rule. This brought a new possibility for the continent to focus energies and resources on shaping its own development, rather than having to devote them to resistance to colonial and racial oppression.

And the conditions for the regeneration of Africa include the growing mass movement of Africans during the past two decades, manifested in struggles against dictatorships and undemocratic rule. Part of this process, and in turn giving it impetus, is the emergence of a new generation of African leaders, capable men and women who are not prepared to accept as inevitable the current conditions under which the ordinary African lives. It is for such reasons that we are hopeful for the future. This is not to gloss over our problems, or to underestimate the scale of what is required. Nor is it to ignore the fact that some of our problems are of our own making as we know from the record of the first decades of independence.

The achievement of our vision requires rapid industrialisation, that exploits our scarcely tapped resources and our strategic geographical location. In turn, that requires massive programmes for infrastructural development for the regeneration of our cities, and for the education of our people. In our interdependent modern world what happens in one country impacts on many others. What happens in Africa impacts on its relations with the world. Sustainable growth and development therefore requires peace, security and stability. And they require the unity of the African continent. Peace is the greatest weapon for development.

Conversely, conflicts and tensions that undermine stability and security can set back the progress that we have started to make on the path of development. What gives hope is that Africa?s leaders are finding creative ways of addressing the resolution of conflicts. We do believe that South Africa?s transition, hailed by many as a miracle, though in reality it was based on the actions of humans, has had a great importance in demonstrating what is possible when the will and the conditions for peace are there.

What is always difficult in life is not so much that we influence and change others, the most difficult question is to change yourself in accordance with the conditions that you confront. And as I have pointed out before, one of the most difficult questions which faced those in jail, those in exile, and those that work on the ground, was to reconcile our emotions with our thinking. Our feeling was that under no circumstances shall we sit down with the apartheid regime who have subjected us for centuries to some of the most painful experiences you can think of. For that reason, it was unthinkable for us to sit down with our enemies and talk. But our brains said if you don?t sit down with these people, your country will go up in smoke, and innocent civilians will be slaughtered. The infrastructure of the country will be destroyed. Community development will come to an end. And the problem was to reconcile these two ? your feelings and your thinking.

We faced problems among our own comrades and colleagues, we faced problems with the enemy that had continued to say for decades ?we will never negotiate with terrorists.? And we had to find a way so that they could cross a bridge without humiliation. It was through the ability to reconcile these two contradictions that we were able to bring about a peaceful transformation in our country and to confound the prophets of doom who predicted that there would never be a peaceful change in our country, that any attempt to bring about changes would engulf South Africa in rivers of blood. We were able to prove them wrong because we were able to change ourselves, first and foremost. And anybody who wants to have an impact on society must start from himself or herself.

Though South Africa has responded whenever requested to assist in the resolution of conflict it is always on the basis that only the participants in the conflict can themselves achieve lasting solutions. I have come from the latest meeting in Arusha [Tanzania] confident that we are on the verge of a breakthrough and that the process will indeed bring lasting peace to Burundi and her people.

Now when I went to Burundi I hardly knew what I know now. I was not aware of the calibre of the leadership of that country. But I was tremendously impressed that out of the 18 political parties you had six graduates in engineering, trained in Brussels, Paris, Germany, and Russia; that you had four graduates in law; two medical doctors; one graduate in mathematics; a graduate in economics; a graduate in French literature; a graduate in biology; a graduate in sociology. That is the calibre of the leadership that we are dealing with. And it was for that reason that, right from the start, I believed for certain that sooner or later we will have a breakthrough.

But the monumental work done by Mwalimu Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, was absolutely impressive. And we had the comparatively easier task of tying up the loose ends. He has done, he did a great deal of the basic work. Now I say that indeed the process of bringing last peace to Burundi and her people is moving, and that is because the two principal conditions for peace are being met. One is that all contending parties should be ready to participate in the process. And the other is a readiness on the part of all leaders to compromise on the basis of a recognition that they have certain interests in common as
Burundians that are more important than whatever differences divide them. Amongst those common principles is that it is totally intolerable that innocent men, women and children, the disabled, should suffer loss of freedom and even be slaughtered because leaders cannot make the compromises required for peace.

The way in which this principle has so often been violated in human history is a tragic indictment of political leadership. What underpins one?s hope for Africa?s future is the way in which the peace process in Burundi has been promoted by the joint efforts of leaders from many African countries, and with the active support of the international community. Together, in consultation with and under the guidance of the Organisation of African Unity, they have been exercising collective responsibility for African peace and security. The international support that has been vital for the peace process will continue to be important in the reconstruction of Burundi that peace will make possible.

Such is the path towards reconstruction and development of Africa. Leaders who do not put the interests of their people above their own, cannot achieve lasting peace and therefore sustainable development. No country in Africa can solve its problem on its own. Nor can Africa achieve her goals on her own. Ambitious programmes of economic reconstruction, insuring peace, stability and security, and dealing with problems deriving from the historical relations of Africa with the rest of the world, requires a pooling of sovereignty, removing the burden of external debt and negotiating equitable trade regimes and systems of investment ? requires a collective African voice that reflects a popular conviction that the continent is indeed on the path towards a rapidly improving life for all its people. And that Africa is indeed returning from the margins to the mainstream of world history.

That is why we include amongst our priorities the building of co-operation with the rest of the South in partnership with the industrialised countries of the North. That is why we lay stress on the development of our regional and continental organisations, and the progress towards economic integration. That is why the entrenchment of democracy is fundamental to our future. Africa?s position in the world today will depend on what Africa does to and with itself.

In the end that is why we do remain confident in our determination that we are at the dawn of the African century. I hope observers from Europe have not lost sight of what is happening in Africa, something which is exemplary for many parts of the world. It is common knowledge that some years back General Obasanjo of Nigeria staged a coup in his country because of reasons which he explained, which in many respects were convincing. But he made an announcement when he staged that coup, that within three years he would hand over power to a civilian authority. He did that.

Then there is the case of General Abubakar also in Nigeria. When Sani Abacha died, General Abubakar took over as head of the military government. At the same time he made a statement, that as soon as he had normalised the situation he would hand over to civilian rule. Both soldiers honoured their commitment. Today General Obasanjo is the President of Nigeria through the ballot box, he is now chairman of the 77 Group of Nations which will be meeting shortly in Havana in Cuba. General Abubakar ? I invited him to the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement because of his declaration that he would hand over to the civilian authority. He was warmly welcomed by delegates from all over the world because of the example he had set. And he was given the honour, at one stage, of chairing the proceedings of the Non-Aligned Movement.

Then you have heard of the case of Nyerere. He knew exactly when to step down. He stepped down at the height of his power and popularity and made way for younger people. President Masire of Botswana has done exactly the same thing. At the height of his popularity he stepped down and made way for younger blood. These things are happening in a continent which is regarded as still living in the dark ages. I want you to open your eyes and to observe what is going on in that continent.

Almost every country, with a few exceptions, has now democratised, and these are developments which give us hope that, whatever problems we have ? and we have many and some of them are very serious -we nonetheless have men and women who are highly gifted and capable of rising to the challenges that face the continent.

You will again excuse me ending up by telling a story, which I have told several times. A young lady of five came to my gate in my house, and security said ?Look, there is a young lady here outside who wants to see you.? I said ?Let her in.? They said ?Mr President, she is very cheeky.? I said ?Precisely for that, let her come in.? And indeed, she was quite a lady. I was sitting in my lounge. She just stormed in, without knocking, and the first question she asked was ?How old are you?? I said ?Well, I am very sorry, I can?t remember. But I was born long, long ago.? She said ?Two years ago?? I said ?No, much longer than that.? Then she changed the subject. ?Why did you go to jail?? I said ?I didn?t go to jail because I liked.

Some people forced me to go there.? ?Who?? ?People who don?t like me.? ?How long did you stay there?? I said ?I can?t remember but it was a very, very long time.? Again the question of two years came in. And when I couldn?t answer her question, she said ?You must be a very stupid old man!? And having said that, she continued talking to me as if she had paid me a compliment.

Ladies and gentlemen, I tell this story so that if you feel that I have not risen to expectations, please be a little more diplomatic than that young lady!",Ceremonial
WE SHALL FIGHT ON THE BEACHES,04-06-1940,Winston Churchill,"From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.

However, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they have never known in their own.

I have said this armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and Calais were the scenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen Victoria?s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be held by the French troops.

2023 International Churchill Conference
Join us for the 40th International Churchill Conference. Edinburgh Scotland, 5-7 October 2023
Thus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and French Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air.

When, a week ago today, I asked the House to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement, I feared it would be my hard lot to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.

That was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to fall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of retreat.

I asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because the facts were not clear, but I do not feel that any reason now exists why we should not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode. The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast.

The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever-narrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought.

Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seamen, strained every nerve to embark the British and Allied troops; 220 light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They had to operate upon the difficult coast, often in adverse weather, under an almost ceaseless hail of bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued. The numbers they have brought back are the measure of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British and French wounded, being so plainly marked were a special target for Nazi bombs; but the men and women on board them never faltered in their duty.

Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already been intervening in the battle, so far as its range would allow, from home bases, now used part of its main metropolitan fighter strength, and struck at the German bombers and at the fighters which in large numbers protected them. This struggle was protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it.

This was a great trial of strength between the British and German Air Forces. Can you conceive a greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible, and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more ammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.

When we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that:

Every morn brought forth a noble chance
And every chance brought forth a noble knight,
deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land.

I return to the Army. In the long series of very fierce battles, now on this front, now on that, fighting on three fronts at once, battles fought by two or three divisions against an equal or somewhat larger number of the enemy, and fought fiercely on some of the old grounds that so many of us knew so well-in these battles our losses in men have exceeded 30,000 killed, wounded and missing. I take occasion to express the sympathy of the House to all who have suffered bereavement or who are still anxious. The President of the Board of Trade [Sir Andrew Duncan] is not here today. His son has been killed, and many in the House have felt the pangs of affliction in the sharpest form. But I will say this about the missing: We have had a large number of wounded come home safely to this country, but I would say about the missing that there may be very many reported missing who will come back home, some day, in one way or another. In the confusion of this fight it is inevitable that many have been left in positions where honor required no further resistance from them.

Against this loss of over 30,000 men, we can set a far heavier loss certainly inflicted upon the enemy. But our losses in material are enormous. We have perhaps lost one-third of the men we lost in the opening days of the battle of 21st March, 1918, but we have lost nearly as many guns ? nearly one thousand-and all our transport, all the armored vehicles that were with the Army in the north. This loss will impose a further delay on the expansion of our military strength. That expansion had not been proceeding as far as we had hoped. The best of all we had to give had gone to the British Expeditionary Force, and although they had not the numbers of tanks and some articles of equipment which were desirable, they were a very well and finely equipped Army. They had the first-fruits of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like of which has never been seen in our records is now being made. Work is proceeding everywhere, night and day, Sundays and week days. Capital and Labor have cast aside their interests, rights, and customs and put them into the common stock. Already the flow of munitions has leaped forward. There is no reason why we should not in a few months overtake the sudden and serious loss that has come upon us, without retarding the development of our general program.

Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have passed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in France and Belgium is a colossal military disaster. The French Army has been weakened, the Belgian Army has been lost, a large part of those fortified lines upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone, many valuable mining districts and factories have passed into the enemy?s possession, the whole of the Channel ports are in his hands, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at France. We are told that Herr Hitler has a plan for invading the British Isles. This has often been thought of before. When Napoleon lay at Boulogne for a year with his flat-bottomed boats and his Grand Army, he was told by someone. ?There are bitter weeds in England.? There are certainly a great many more of them since the British Expeditionary Force returned.

The whole question of home defense against invasion is, of course, powerfully affected by the fact that we have for the time being in this Island incomparably more powerful military forces than we have ever had at any moment in this war or the last. But this will not continue. We shall not be content with a defensive war. We have our duty to our Ally. We have to reconstitute and build up the British Expeditionary Force once again, under its gallant Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort. All this is in train; but in the interval we must put our defenses in this Island into such a high state of organization that the fewest possible numbers will be required to give effective security and that the largest possible potential of offensive effort may be realized. On this we are now engaged. It will be very convenient, if it be the desire of the House, to enter upon this subject in a secret Session. Not that the government would necessarily be able to reveal in very great detail military secrets, but we like to have our discussions free, without the restraint imposed by the fact that they will be read the next day by the enemy; and the Government would benefit by views freely expressed in all parts of the House by Members with their knowledge of so many different parts of the country. I understand that some request is to be made upon this subject, which will be readily acceded to by His Majesty?s Government.

We have found it necessary to take measures of increasing stringency, not only against enemy aliens and suspicious characters of other nationalities, but also against British subjects who may become a danger or a nuisance should the war be transported to the United Kingdom. I know there are a great many people affected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi Germany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present time and under the present stress, draw all the distinctions which we should like to do. If parachute landings were attempted and fierce fighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far better out of the way, for their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the slightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House, without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively stamped out.

Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised.

I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty?s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God?s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.",Ceremonial

Best Original Song Oscars Award Acceptance Speech,22-02-2015,John Legend and Common,"First off, I'd like to thank God that lives in us all. Recently, John and I got to go to Selma and perform ""Glory"" on the same bridge that Dr. King and the people of the civil rights movement marched on 50 years ago. This bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation, but now is a symbol for change. The spirit of this bridge transcends race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and social status. The spirit of this bridge connects the kid from the South side of Chicago, dreaming of a better life to those in France standing up for their freedom of expression to the people in Hong Kong protesting for democracy. This bridge was built on hope. Welded with compassion. And elevated by love for all human beings.

Thank you. Nina Simone said it's an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live. We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were 50 years ago, but we say Selma is now, because the struggle for justice is right now. We know that the voting rights, the act that they fought for 50 years ago is being compromised right now in this country today. We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850.

Barack Obama 2008 presidential election victory speech,04-11-2008,Barack Obama,"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.

It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference.

It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled ? Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of red states and blue states; we are, and always will be, the United States of America.

Sponsor Message
It's the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.

It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.

I just received a very gracious call from Sen. McCain. He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him and Gov. Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.

I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the vice-president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.

I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation's next first lady, Michelle Obama. Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure.

To my campaign manager, David Plouffe; my chief strategist, David Axelrod; and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics ? you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.

But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to ? it belongs to you.

I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington ? it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.

It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this earth. This is your victory.

I know you didn't do this just to win an election, and I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime ? two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.

The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year, or even one term, but America ? I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you: We as a people will get there.

There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for 221 years ? block by block, brick by brick, callused hand by callused hand.

What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek ? it is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It cannot happen without you.

So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other. Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers. In this country, we rise or fall as one nation ? as one people.

Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long. Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House ? a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty and national unity. Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.

As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, ""We are not enemies, but friends... Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection."" And, to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your president, too.

And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world ? our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those who would tear this world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight, we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.

For that is the true genius of America ? that America can change. Our union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.

This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election, except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.

She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons ? because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.

And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America ? the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes, we can.

At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes, we can.

When there was despair in the Dust Bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose. Yes, we can.

When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes, we can.

She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that ""We Shall Overcome."" Yes, we can.

A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. Yes, we can.

America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves: If our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?

This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time ? to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.

Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.",Ceremonial
Bill Gates at Harvard University,07-07-2007,Bill Gates,"President Bok, former President Rudenstine, incoming President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, parents, and especially, the graduates:

I?ve been waiting more than 30 years to say this: ?Dad, I always told you I?d come back and get my degree.?

I want to thank Harvard for this timely honor. I?ll be changing my job next year ? and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume.

I applaud the graduates today for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I?m just happy that the Crimson has called me ?Harvard?s most successful dropout.? I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class ? I did the best of everyone who failed.

But I also want to be recognized as the guy who got Steve Ballmer to drop out of business school. I?m a bad influence. That?s why I was invited to speak at your graduation. If I had spoken at your orientation, fewer of you might be here today.

Harvard was just a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn?t even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Currier House. There were always lots of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew I didn?t worry about getting up in the morning. That?s how I came to be the leader of the anti-social group. We clung to each other as a way of validating our rejection of all those social people.

Radcliffe was a great place to live. There were more women up there, and most of the guys were science-math types. That combination offered me the best odds, if you know what I mean. This is where I learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesn?t guarantee success.

One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975, when I made a call from Currier House to a company in Albuquerque that had begun making the world?s first personal computers. I offered to sell them software.

I worried that they would realize I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me. Instead they said: ?We?re not quite ready, come see us in a month,? which was a good thing, because we hadn?t written the software yet. From that moment, I worked day and night on this little extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft.

What I remember above all about Harvard was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence. It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging, but always challenging. It was an amazing privilege ? and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made, and the ideas I worked on.

But taking a serious look back ? I do have one big regret.

I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world ? the appalling disparities of health, and wealth, and opportunity that condemn millions of people to lives of despair.

I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas in economics and politics. I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences.

But humanity?s greatest advances are not in its discoveries ? but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care, or broad economic opportunity ? reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.

I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country. And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries.

It took me decades to find out.

You graduates came to Harvard at a different time. You know more about the world?s inequities than the classes that came before. In your years here, I hope you?ve had a chance to think about how ? in this age of accelerating technology ? we can finally take on these inequities, and we can solve them.

Imagine, just for the sake of discussion, that you had a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause ? and you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives. Where would you spend it?

For Melinda and for me, the challenge is the same: how can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have.

During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who were dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we had long ago made harmless in this country. Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis B, yellow fever. One disease I had never even heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million kids each year ? none of them in the United States.

We were shocked. We had just assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar, there were interventions that could save lives that just weren?t being delivered.

If you believe that every life has equal value, it?s revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves: ?This can?t be true. But if it is true, it deserves to be the priority of our giving.?

So we began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked: ?How could the world let these children die??

The answer is simple, and harsh. The market did not reward saving the lives of these children, and governments did not subsidize it. So the children died because their mothers and their fathers had no power in the market and no voice in the system.

But you and I have both.

We can make market forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism ? if we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit, or at least make a living, serving people who are suffering from the worst inequities. We also can press governments around the world to spend taxpayer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes.

If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world.
This task is open-ended. It can never be finished. But a conscious effort to answer this challenge will change the world.

I am optimistic that we can do this, but I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope. They say: ?Inequity has been with us since the beginning, and will be with us till the end ? because people just ? don?t ? care.?
I completely disagree.

I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with.

All of us here in this Yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our hearts, and yet we did nothing ? not because we didn?t care, but because we didn?t know what to do. If we had known how to help, we would have acted.

The barrier to change is not too little caring; it is too much complexity.

To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution, and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps.

Even with the advent of the Internet and 24-hour news, it is still a complex enterprise to get people to truly see the problems. When an airplane crashes, officials immediately call a press conference. They promise to investigate, determine the cause, and prevent similar crashes in the future.

But if the officials were brutally honest, they would say: ?Of all the people in the world who died today from preventable causes, one half of one percent of them were on this plane. We?re determined to do everything possible to solve the problem that took the lives of the one half of one percent.?

The bigger problem is not the plane crash, but the millions of preventable deaths.

We don?t read much about these deaths. The media covers what?s new ? and millions of people dying is nothing new. So it stays in the background, where it?s easier to ignore. But even when we do see it or read about it, it?s difficult to keep our eyes on the problem. It?s hard to look at suffering if the situation is so complex that we don?t know how to help. And so we look away.

If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step: cutting through the complexity to find a solution.

Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring. If we have clear and proven answers anytime an organization or individual asks ?How can I help?,? then we can get action ? and we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted. But complexity makes it hard to mark a path of action for everyone who cares ? and that makes it hard for their caring to matter.

Cutting through complexity to find a solution runs through four predictable stages: determine a goal, find the highest-leverage approach, discover the ideal technology for that approach, and in the meantime, make the smartest application of the technology that you already have ? whether it?s something sophisticated, like a drug, or something simpler, like a bednet.

The AIDS epidemic offers an example. The broad goal, of course, is to end the disease. The highest-leverage approach is prevention. The ideal technology would be a vaccine that gives lifetime immunity with a single dose. So governments, drug companies, and foundations fund vaccine research. But their work is likely to take more than a decade, so in the meantime, we have to work with what we have in hand ? and the best prevention approach we have now is getting people to avoid risky behavior.

Pursuing that goal starts the four-step cycle again. This is the pattern. The crucial thing is to never stop thinking and working ? and never do what we did with malaria and tuberculosis in the 20th century ? which is to surrender to complexity and quit.

The final step ? after seeing the problem and finding an approach ? is to measure the impact of your work and share your successes and failures so that others learn from your efforts.

You have to have the statistics, of course. You have to be able to show that a program is vaccinating millions more children. You have to be able to show a decline in the number of children dying from these diseases. This is essential not just to improve the program, but also to help draw more investment from business and government.

But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers; you have to convey the human impact of the work ? so people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected.

I remember going to Davos some years back and sitting on a global health panel that was discussing ways to save millions of lives. Millions! Think of the thrill of saving just one person?s life ? then multiply that by millions. ? Yet this was the most boring panel I?ve ever been on ? ever. So boring even I couldn?t bear it.

What made that experience especially striking was that I had just come from an event where we were introducing version 13 of some piece of software, and we had people jumping and shouting with excitement. I love getting people excited about software ? but why can?t we generate even more excitement for saving lives?

You can?t get people excited unless you can help them see and feel the impact. And how you do that ? is a complex question.

Still, I?m optimistic. Yes, inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever. They are new ? they can help us make the most of our caring ? and that?s why the future can be different from the past.

The defining and ongoing innovations of this age ? biotechnology, the computer, the Internet ? give us a chance we?ve never had before to end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease.

Sixty years ago, George Marshall came to this commencement and announced a plan to assist the nations of post-war Europe. He said: ?I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. It is virtually impossible at this distance to grasp at all the real significance of the situation.?

Thirty years after Marshall made his address, as my class graduated without me, technology was emerging that would make the world smaller, more open, more visible, less distant.

The emergence of low-cost personal computers gave rise to a powerful network that has transformed opportunities for learning and communicating.

The magical thing about this network is not just that it collapses distance and makes everyone your neighbor. It also dramatically increases the number of brilliant minds we can have working together on the same problem ? and that scales up the rate of innovation to a staggering degree.

At the same time, for every person in the world who has access to this technology, five people don?t. That means many creative minds are left out of this discussion ? smart people with practical intelligence and relevant experience who don?t have the technology to hone their talents or contribute their ideas to the world.

We need as many people as possible to have access to this technology, because these advances are triggering a revolution in what human beings can do for one another. They are making it possible not just for national governments, but for universities, corporations, smaller organizations, and even individuals to see problems, see approaches, and measure the impact of their efforts to address the hunger, poverty, and desperation George Marshall spoke of 60 years ago.

Members of the Harvard Family: Here in the Yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world.

What for?

There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students, and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world. But can we do more? Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name?

Let me make a request of the deans and the professors ? the intellectual leaders here at Harvard: As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum, and determine degree requirements, please ask yourselves:

Should our best minds be dedicated to solving our biggest problems?

Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the world?s worst inequities? Should Harvard students learn about the depth of global poverty ? the prevalence of world hunger ? the scarcity of clean water ?the girls kept out of school ? the children who die from diseases we can cure?

Should the world?s most privileged people learn about the lives of the world?s least privileged?

These are not rhetorical questions ? you will answer with your policies.

My mother, who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here ? never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before my wedding, she hosted a bridal event, at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time, but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the close of the letter she said: ?From those to whom much is given, much is expected.?

When you consider what those of us here in this Yard have been given ? in talent, privilege, and opportunity ? there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us.

In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue ? a complex problem, a deep inequity, and become a specialist on it. If you make it the focus of your career, that would be phenomenal. But you don?t have to do that to make an impact. For a few hours every week, you can use the growing power of the Internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers, and find ways to cut through them.

Don?t let complexity stop you. Be activists. Take on the big inequities. It will be one of the great experiences of your lives.

You graduates are coming of age in an amazing time. As you leave Harvard, you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity, which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed conscience that will torment you if you abandon these people whose lives you could change with very little effort.
You have more than we had; you must start sooner, and carry on longer.

Knowing what you know, how could you not?

And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect on what you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone, but also on how well you have addressed the world?s deepest inequities ? on how well you treated people a world away who have nothing in common with you but their humanity.

Good luck.",Ceremonial
Michelle Obama at Spelman College,15-05-2011,Michelle Obama,"Well, goodness.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Let me tell you it is a pleasure and an honor -- yes, Chicago -- (laughter and applause) -- to be with all of you today.

And I want to thank President Tatum for her leadership and for that very kind and generous introduction.  She is such an inspiration to all of the women who are part of the
Spelman family, so let?s give her our thanks and round of applause.  (Applause.)

I also want to acknowledge a few people who are here in the audience:  Senator Isakson, Representative Johnson, and of course Mayor Reed.  Thank you all so much for joining us today.  Thank you all for your leadership.  (Applause.)

And I want to give a special shoutout to one of my people, one of my staff members, Ms. Kristen Jarvis of Spelman class of 2003.  (Applause.)  Look, ladies, you want to know what Spelman does for you?  Kristen is my right-hand woman.  She travels with me all across the country and around the world.  I don't know what I would do without her.  She has been with me from the very beginning, looking after my girls, taking care of my mom.  So I want to thank Spelman for giving me Kristen.  (Applause.)

And again, let?s take a moment to thank all of those beautiful people sitting behind you all today and standing behind you every day, the folks who brought you into this world -- (applause) -- the folks who showed you, with their love, that you belong here.  They pushed you, they believed in you, and they answered calls those late nights, even when you were just calling for money.  (Laughter.)  So again, let?s give a special round of applause for all the families here today.  (Applause.)

And of course, most of all, to the Spelman class of 2011, congratulations!  (Applause.)  We are so, so proud of you.  We?re proud of the effort you?ve invested and the risks that you took.  We?re proud of the bonds that you forged, the growth that you?ve showed.  We?re proud of how, for the past four years, you?ve immersed yourselves in the life of this school and embraced all that it has to offer.  In doing so, you didn?t just write a chapter in your own life story.  You also became part of the Spelman story ?- a story that began 130 years ago about 10 miles down the road from where we are today.

And by now, all of you know the details: about how two white women from up North ?- Sophia Packard and Harriet Giles -? (laughter) -- came here to Atlanta to establish the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary.  Now we want the world to know this story.  They started out in a dank church basement loaned to them by a kindly preacher named Father Quarles.  And their first class had just 11 students, many of whom were former slaves.

Back then, the thought of an African American woman learning to read and write was, to so many, laughable at best, an impossibility at worst.  And plenty of people tried to dissuade Miss Packard and Miss Giles from founding this school.  They said the South was too dangerous.  They said that at the ages of 56 and 48, these women were too old.

But these two ladies were unmoved.  As Miss Giles put it ?- and these are her words ?- they were determined to lift up ?these women and girls who have never had a chance.?

It?s a story that has been told and re-told, enacted and re-enacted, in every generation since the day that Spelman first opened its doors.

In a time of black codes and lynching, this school was training African American women to be leaders in education, in the health professions.

In a time of legalized segregation, this school was establishing math and biology departments and training a generation of black women scientists.  (Applause.)

At a time when many workplaces were filled with not just glass ceilings, but brick walls, this school was urging black women to become doctors, and lawyers, engineers, ambassadors.

Now, that is the story of Spelman college: that unyielding presumption of promise, that presumption of brilliance, that presumption that every woman who enrolls at this school has something infinitely valuable to offer this world.

And ladies, that is now your story.  That legacy is now your inheritance.  And I?ve chosen that word ?- inheritance ?- very carefully, because it?s not an entitlement that you can take for granted.  It?s not a gift with which you can do whatever you please.  It is a commitment that comes with a certain set of obligations, obligations that don?t end when you march through that arch today.

And that?s really what I want to talk with you about this afternoon.  I want to talk about the obligations that come with a Spelman education, and how I believe you all might fulfill those obligations going forward.

So let?s go back again to those first 11 women in that church basement all those years ago.  Their teachers started with nothing but a couple of Bibles, some notebooks and some pencils.  When it rained, it got so damp in that church that grass started growing on the floor.  Often, the stove was so smoky, and the light was so poor, that students could barely see their teachers.

But still, week after week, more women showed up to enroll.  Some walked eight or nine miles each way.  Many were older, in their 30s, 40s and 50s.  Doesn?t sound so old to me.  (Laughter.)  And often, they were ridiculed.  But they kept coming.

One student, a woman named Mary Ann Brooks, simply stated ?- and these are her words: ?I spoke of going to school, and people laughed at me and said ?You go to school!  You too old!  You?re so old you?ll die there.?  But I told them it was just as good a place to die in as I ever wanted, and I knew Miss Packard and Miss Giles would bury me, so I just came right along.?  (Laughter and applause.)

Now, that spark, that spirit, that odds-defying tenacity has defined the alumnae of this school from its very first graduating class.

I mean, think about one of my heroines, Marian Wright Edelman, class of 1960 -- (applause) -- working as a young civil rights lawyer down in Mississippi.  Attorneys in judge?s chambers refused to shake her hand.  The sheriff locked the doors against her when she came to visit her clients in jail.  She was always careful to leave the door open when she started her car in the morning.  That way, if somebody had planted a car bomb, she had a chance of being injured rather than killed.  But through it all, she continued to represent her clients.  She continued to resist unjust laws with every fiber of her being.

Then there?s Janet Bragg, class of 1925, who was determined to be a pilot.  When she was barred from flying out of segregated airports, she worked with her flying school classmates and instructors to build their own airfield.

When she was rejected from the Women Airforce Service pilots because of her race, she enrolled in a civilian training program instead.

And when she completed her training, but an instructor unfairly prevented her from receiving her license, she picked up and moved to Chicago, passed the exam, and became the first African American woman to earn a commercial pilot?s license.  (Applause.)  Of her experiences, she said: ?There were so many things they said women couldn?t do and blacks couldn?t do.  Every defeat to me was a challenge.?

And for six generations, that is what Spelman women have done.  They have seen every defeat as a challenge.  Now, did they have moments of doubt, anxiety and fear?  Did they have moments of despair when they thought about giving up, or giving in?  Of course they did.  We all do.


And I am no exception.  I mean, some of you may have grown up like me, in neighborhoods where few had the chance to go to college, where being teased for doing well in school was a fact of life, where well-meaning, but misguided folks questioned whether a girl with my background could get into a school like Princeton.

Sometimes, I?d save them the trouble, and raise the questions myself, in my own head, lying awake at night, doubting whether I had what it took to succeed.  And the truth is that there will always be folks out there who make assumptions about others.

There will always be folks who try to raise themselves up by cutting other people down.  That happens to everyone, including me, throughout their lives.  But when that happens to you all, here?s what I want you to do. I want you to just stop a minute.  Take a deep breath, because it?s going to need to be deep -- (laughter) -- and I want you to think about all those women who came before you, women like those first 11 students.  (Applause.)  Think about how they didn?t sit around bemoaning their lack of resources and opportunities and affirmation.

I want you to think about women like Marian Wright Edelman and Janet Bragg.  They didn?t go around pointing fingers and making excuses for why they couldn?t win a case or soar above the horizon.  They were Spelman women with the privilege of a Spelman education.  And instead of focusing on what they didn?t have, they focused on what they did have:  their intellect, their courage, their determination, their passion.

And with few advantages and long odds, with doors closed to them and laws stacked against them, still they achieved, still they triumphed, still they carved a glorious path for themselves in this world.

And graduates, every single one of you has an obligation to do the same.  You have an obligation to see each setback as a challenge and as an opportunity to learn and grow.  You have an obligation to face whatever life throws your way with confidence and with hope.

And don?t ever let anyone get into your head, especially yourself, because if it?s one thing I can promise you, it?s this:  With a Spelman education, you all have everything you need, right here and right now, to be everything you?ve ever wanted to be.  (Applause.)

But let?s be clear, the Spelman legacy isn?t just about those first 11 women.  And it?s not just about the generations of students and alumnae who came after them. It?s about everyone who believed in those women, it?s about everyone who invested in those women, right from the beginning.

I mean, make no mistake about it, Miss Packard, Miss Giles, they were ambitious for their students.  Even as they started their classes at a first grade level, teaching the alphabet and basic arithmetic, they had big dreams.  They were planning to build a full-scale liberal arts college for African American women.

I mean, think about that.  They could barely afford to keep their doors open.  Their students could barely read or write.  But already, they were planning to build something big, a college.  And in those early years, they actually rejected an offer to merge with the Atlanta Baptist Seminary, the school that eventually became Morehouse.  Yep, said, ?No thank you, brothers!? -- (laughter and applause) -- because this move would have -- may have solved all their financial problems.  But they were afraid that a coed school -- their students would be treated as second class citizens.  And they weren?t going to stand for that.  No.  (Applause.)

Then there was Father Quarles, the preacher who lent them his church basement.  He undertook an arduous journey North to raise money for the school.  And his last words to the students were: ?I am going North for you.  I may never return.  But remember, if I die, I die for you and in a good cause.?

And those words turned out to be prophetic.  In the end, the harsh climate was too much, and he got sick and passed away not long after.

Miss Giles, Miss Packard, Father Quarles, they weren?t the only ones who believed in these students.  In those early years, thousands of dollars of donations poured in from the black community itself.  I mean, these were folks who likely didn?t have a dime to spare, digging deep into their wallets to support this school.  See, that fierce devotion to the potential of others, that commitment to give even when you?re barely getting by yourself, all of that is your legacy as well.

That is your mission now too.  (Applause.)  Your mission is to find those 11 women wherever in the world your journey may take you.  Find those folks who have so much potential, but so little opportunity, and do for them what Spelman has done for you.   Maybe it?s a group of kids in your community.  Maybe it?s a struggling family at your church.  And I?m not just talking about here at home.  Maybe it?s folks in a village or an inner-city halfway around the world.

Wherever you go, I guarantee you that you will find folks who have been discounted or dismissed, but who have every bit as much promise as you have.  They just haven?t had the chance to fulfill it.  It is your obligation to bring Spelman to those folks -? to bring that same presumption of value and worth, to make that same kind of sacrifice, to be as ambitious for them as Spelman has been for you.

And in so doing, I can promise you that you won?t just enrich their lives, you?ll immeasurably enrich your own lives as well.

All of you already know this from your own experiences here at Spelman.  Over the past four years, you all have been serving your community in every way possible: tutoring kids, bringing meals to seniors, building homes, and so much more.

And I can tell you from my own experience just how rewarding it can be to make this kind of work the work of your careers.  Back when I was sitting right where you are, I was certain that I wanted to be a lawyer.  I knew it.  So I did everything I was supposed to do.  I got my law degree.  Got a prestigious job at a fancy law firm.  Had a nice big ?ol paycheck and was finally making a dent in my student loans.  My friends were impressed.  My family proud -- and relieved.  (Laughter.)  By all appearances, I was living the dream.

But all the while, I knew something was missing, because the truth is, I didn?t want to be up in that tall building, alone in an office writing memos.  I wanted to be on the ground, working with the folks I grew up with.  I wanted to be mentoring young people.  I wanted to be helping families put food on the table and a roof over their heads.  I wanted to be out there giving folks the same kind of chances that I had.  (Applause.)

So much to the surprise of my family and friends, I left that secure, high-paying job and eventually became the Executive Director of a non-profit, working to help young people get involved in public service.  I was making a lot less money -- a lot -- and my office was a lot smaller.  But I woke up every morning with a sense of purpose and possibility.  I went to work every day feeling excited -- (applause) -- because with every young person I inspired, I felt myself becoming inspired.  With every community I engaged, I felt more engaged and alive than I?d felt in years.

Now, I?m not saying that you have to devote your entire career to public service, though I hope that many of you will.  The private sector has all kinds of meaningful, satisfying opportunities.  And there is nothing wrong with taking home a nice paycheck.  And many of you will need that money to help pay off your student loans and support your families.  That, I know.  And it is vitally important that you all rise to the highest ranks of every industry and of profession.  (Applause.)

But as you climb those career ladders, just remember to reach down and pull others up behind you.  (Applause.)  That?s what so many folks have done for you all.  And now it is your turn to repay the favor.

Now, juggling these obligations to yourself and to others won?t be easy.  And I know that along with the pride and joy you?re feeling today, you may also be feeling some worry and some anxiety.  Some of you may be worrying about getting a job or getting into grad school.  Others may be wondering what it will be like to move back home with mom and dad again.  And let me tell you there are plenty of moms and dads here who are wondering the same thing.  (Laughter.)

But today, and every day going forward, I want you to remember one last legacy that Spelman has left you.  It has left you each other.

I mean, look at all these beautiful, magnificent women beside you.  (Applause.)  It is breathtaking.  (Applause.)  Think of all the connections that you have, all those experiences that you?ve shared.  The first time you set foot on the campus during Spelbound.  Crying your eyes out together at the parting ceremony.  Sweating through the night in those un-air conditioned freshman dorms.  (Applause.)  Sounds pretty rough.  (Laughter.)  Maybe the alumni can help out with that.  (Laughter and applause.)  All those classes, convocations, Christmas concerts -- ooh, and the late night conversations about some man.  (Laughter.)  You all know you were doing that.  (Laughter.)  You all are the keepers of each other?s histories.  And the bonds that you?ve formed here will nourish you and sustain you for the rest of your lives.  Now, that is sisterhood.  (Applause.)

And look at all these magnificent women around all of you ?- the alumnae of this institution who led you through that arch on Friday, cheering you on as you start your journey into the world.

I?m told that back in the depths of the recession in 2009, when many seniors here couldn?t pay their tuition bills, President Tatum made an appeal to Spelman alumnae, parents and friends asking for help.  And even though times were tough for everyone, enough gifts poured in to help 100 seniors graduate from Spelman that year.  (Applause.)  That is sisterhood.  (Applause.)

And finally, think back over the years to all those who have made this day possible: Miss Giles, Miss Packard, Father Quarles, and so many others.  Think about all those anonymous folks who were just barely getting by themselves, but still found a way to support this school.  Those folks never had the chance to get an education themselves -- never -- but they were determined that other young people would.  Even if it wasn?t their daughters.  Even if it wasn?t their grand-daughters, because, see, what you all have to understand is that hope, that yearning, that wasn?t just about themselves and their own families.  It was about a vision for us as a people, and as a nation, where every child can develop every last bit of their God-given potential.  (Applause.)

Graduates, you are their dream come true.  You are the culmination of their sacrifice, of their longing, of their love.  You are part of a glorious sisterhood ?- past, present and future.  You have a diploma that will take you places you?ve never even dreamed of.  (Applause.)

And no matter what obstacles you encounter, no matter what hardships you endure, all of you have that for life.  No one can ever take that away from you.

And today, I want to end with some words from Tina McElroy Ansa, Spelman class of 1971.  (Applause.)  In one of her novels, she wrote, simply: ?Claim what is yours?You belong anywhere on this earth you want to.?

And graduates, if you go out there and make that claim, if you reach back to help others do the same, then I am confident that you will lead lives worthy of your dreams, and you will fulfill that precious Spelman legacy that is now yours.

So congratulations, graduates, on all that you have achieved.  I am so proud of you, all of you.  We are so proud of you.  Do big things.  Thank you, and God bless. (Applause.)",Ceremonial
"ADDRESS BY THE HON'BLE PRESIDENT OF INDIA, SMT. DROUPADI MURMU AT THE 17TH CONVOCATION OF MIZORAM UNIVERSITY AND INAUGURATION AND LAYING OF FOUNDATION STONES FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS",03-11-2022,SMT. DROUPADI MURMU,"It gives me immense pleasure to attend the 17th Convocation of Mizoram University today at Aizawl. Aizawl is the largest city and the capital of Mizoram. This beautiful City is situated on a ridge with the Tlawng river valley to its west and the Tuirial river valley to its east. Different Mizo communities live here in peaceful coexistence. This lively and bustling city is attractive beyond description.

First I would like to congratulate all the graduating students and winners of gold medals and prizes. I also congratulate the Fraternity of Mizoram University for organising this convocation and to have strived hard for emerging as one of the best institutions in the North-Eastern Region.

I am happy to note that Mizoram University, which started functioning in 2001, is today a prominent University in the North-Eastern Region providing quality education. The University has 39 academic departments spread under 10 schools and 41 affiliated UG colleges, Nursing, Medical and Para-medical colleges and District Institutes of Education and Training.

I am happy to learn that Mizoram University has two sprawling campuses at Tanhril and Pachhunga. The University has a diverse student community comprising of students from all over the country and abroad. The University has made serious efforts in promoting academics that resulted in remarkable progress in the fields of Science, Arts, Commerce, Engineering and Medical Sciences. The University has gained the status of Institution of Eminence and taken some path breaking initiatives. The infrastructural development of Mizoram University within a very short span of time is indeed commendable.

Mizoram University has been ranked as one of the top 100 Universities, by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) Ranking from 2016 to 2022. It was ranked 78th in 2022 under the Universities category among 900 Universities. The University, at the PG and UG level, has fully adopted the Choice Based Credit System that allows students freedom of choices in their discipline. It is one of the few universities in the entire country which has implemented the National Education Policy-2020 from the academic year 2022-2023.

I am happy to know that the university campus is eco-friendly and solar power supply supports major energy needs in the Campus. The Campus also hosts diverse flora and fauna. I urge other educational institutions also to adopt eco-friendly measures and sensitise students towards the environment.

The Mizoram University has three Incubators for providing innovative and practical training to the students. Faculty members of Mizoram University have been awarded a large number of research projects and have various scientific accomplishments to their credit through research publications, books and patents.

The University has signed MoUs with various universities and organisations at national and international level such as, University of Minnesota, USA; National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan; University of Malaysia; Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati; Mizoram Youth Commission; Engineering Projects (India) Limited, and other important organisations for various academic and technological collaborations. This has set a new template for other higher education institutions to explore avenues for collaborating with national and international organisations and create new benchmarks of excellence in academic and technological spheres.

Dear students and scholars,

Convocation is a historic occasion and marks the realization of dreams, innovation, commitment and hard work of the students and faculty members. For you, this is a moment of great satisfaction, joy and pride. It is important, on this occasion, to remember and recognize the efforts of those who have supported you throughout your journeys. Here I mean your family members who make sacrifices to enable you to reach your destination.

Today, unlimited opportunities stretch out before you. There is no limit to your capabilities, so just realize your potential. You are the best judge of your own talent and potential. Explore the world and do new experiments.

Here, I would quote Robert Frost

""Two roads diverged in a wood, and 

I took the one less travelled by,

And that has made all the difference. (Unquote)


I further urge you all to take up the responsibility of educating the uneducated and spreading the light of knowledge. I am certain that you will continue to make your Alma Mater proud, as you have done today, on this 17th Convocation of Mizoram University.

I am very happy to know that out of 6826 students graduated in this academic session of 2021-22, more than 50 percent are girls. Also out of 64 gold medals, 40 have been won by girl students. Among book prize winners also, 15 out of 25 are girls. I appreciate that number of females in higher education is rising but it should rise at a higher rate. We should also ensure that participation of women in education should translate into increased participation in workforce also. When the women progress, the entire country progresses.

I am happy to inaugurate and lay foundation stones of various projects of state government and central government today. The inauguration of two scheduled tribe girls hostels at Mizoram University and at Sairang today is a step towards empowerment of girl students by providing access to quality education and other facilities.

I am happy to inaugurate the permanent campus of Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) Aizawl which will be a boost to the media and mass communication studies in the entire North-East. IIMC is an esteemed institution which provides a dynamic learning and working environment which nurtures new ideas, creativity, research and develops leaders and innovators in the domain of media and mass communication.

The inauguration of new campus of Government Aizawl College in Mualpui, Aizawl will enhance quality of education and will provide better facilities for the students.

I am sure that the new Post Graduate academic block at Pachhunga University College will play a significant role in enhancing educational infrastructure.

I once again congratulate the graduating students and winners of gold medals and prizes and extend best wishes to the entire fraternity of Mizoram University.

Thank you,

Jai Hind!",Ceremonial
The Great Dictator,31-10-1940,Charlie Chaplin,"I?m sorry, but I don?t want to be an emperor. That?s not my business. I don?t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other?s happiness - not by each other?s misery. We don?t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men?s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost?

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.


To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish?

Soldiers! don?t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don?t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don?t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don?t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ?the Kingdom of God is within man? - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men?s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!",Entertainment
Independence Day,03-07-1996,Bill Pullman,"Good morning. Good morning. In less than an hour aircrafts from here will join others from around the world and you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind.
Mankind, that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can?t be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it?s fate that today is the 4th of July and you will once again be fighting for our freedom not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution but from annihilation.
We?re fighting for our right to live, to exist, and should we win today the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday but as the day when the world declared in one voice,
?We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. We?re going to live on. We?re going to survive. Today we celebrate our Independence Day!?",Entertainment
Any Given Sunday,16-12-1999,Al Pacino,"I don't know what to say, really. Three minutes till the biggest battle of our professional lives all comes down to today. Now either we heal as a team or we?re gonna crumble, inch by inch, play by play, 'til we're finished.

We're in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. And, we can stay here -- get the shit kicked out of us -- or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell one inch at a time.

Now, I can't do it for you. I'm too old. I look around. I see these young faces, and I think -- I mean -- I made every wrong choice a middle-aged man can make. I, uh, I pissed away all my money, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who's ever loved me. And lately, I can't even stand the face I see in the mirror.

You know, when you get old in life things get taken from you. I mean that's...part of life. But, you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You find out life?s this game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life or football, the margin for error is so small -- I mean one-half a step too late, or too early, and you don?t quite make it. One-half second too slow, too fast, you don?t quite catch it.

The inches we need are everywhere around us.

They?re in every break of the game, every minute, every second.

On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch, because we know when we add up all those inches that?s gonna make the fuckin' difference between winning and losing! Between livin' and dyin'!

I?ll tell you this: In any fight, it?s the guy who?s willing to die who?s gonna win that inch. And I know if I?m gonna have any life anymore, it?s because I?m still willin' to fight and die for that inch. Because that?s what livin' is! The six inches in front of your face!!

Now I can?t make you do it. You got to look at the guy next to you. Look into his eyes! Now I think you?re gonna see a guy who will go that inch with you. You're gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows, when it comes down to it, you?re gonna do the same for him!

That?s a team, gentleman!

And, either we heal, now, as a team, or we will die as individuals.

That?s football guys.

Well I want you to understand somethin'. To me, being perfect is not about that scoreboard out there. It's not about winning. It's about you and your relationship to yourself and your family and your friends.

Being perfect is about being able to look your friends in the eye and know that you didn't let them down, because you told them the truth. And that truth is that you did everything that you could. There wasn't one more thing that you could've done.



Can you live in that moment, as best you can, with clear eyes and love in your heart? With joy in your heart?

If you can do that gentlemen, then you're perfect.

I want you to take a moment. And I want you to look each other in the eyes. I want you to put each other in your hearts forever, because forever's about to happen here in just a few minutes.

My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
If we are mark?d to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God?s will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet honour,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
God?s peace! I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more, methinks, would share from me
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
We would not die in that man?s company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say ?To-morrow is Saint Crispian:?
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say ?These wounds I had on Crispin?s day.?
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
But he?ll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember?d.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne?er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember?d;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne?er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks

It's the one night of the year when we all act a little nicer; we smile a little easier, we cheer a little more.  

For a couple of hours out of the whole year, we are the people that we always hoped we would be.  

It's a miracle.  It's really a sort of a miracle because it happens every Christmas Eve.  And if you waste that miracle, you're going to burn for it.  

I know what I'm talking about.  You have to to do something.  You have to take a chance.  You do have to get involved.  

There are people that are having trouble making make their miracle happen.  

There are people that don't have enough to eat.  

There are people that are cold.  

You can go out and say hello to these people.  

You can take an old blanket out of the closet and say, ""Here.""  

You can make them a sandwich and say, ""Oh by the way, here.""  I get it now.   And if you give, then it can happen.  Then the miracle can happen to you.  

It's not just the poor and the hungry; it's everybody who has got to have this miracle.  And it can happen tonight for all of you.

For from free Greek to free Greek, the word was spread that bold Leonidas and his 300, so far from home, laid down their lives -- not just for Sparta, but for all Greece, and the promise this country holds.

Now, here on this ragged patch of earth called Plataea, Xerxes hordes face obliteration!

ust there the barbarians huddle, sheer terror gripping tight their hearts with icy fingers -- knowing full well what merciless horrors they suffered at the swords and spears of 300.

Yet, they stare now across the plain at 10,000 Spartans commanding 30,000.

You?ve never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. Seen that. If I ask you about women, you?d probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can?t tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You?re a tough kid. If I ask you about war, you?d probably throw Shakespeare at me, right? ?Once more into the breach, dear friends.? But you?ve never been near one. You?ve never held your best friend?s head in your lap and watch him gasp his last breath, looking to you for help. If I ask you about love, you?d probably quote me a sonnet.

Importance of Sleep,08-03-2017,Taylor Fondie,"according to Scientific American March
25th 2002 17-year old Randy Gardner in
1965 set an all-time world record all
for a science fair project as part of a
sleep deprivation experiment by staying
awake for 264 hours that is 11 days the

first day his eyes had stopped focusing
later he lost ability to recognize
objects by touch
he became Moony and uncoordinated at the
end of this experiment he had trouble
with concentration short-term memory
became paranoid and started
hallucinating Gardner recovered with no
mental or physical damage you see
getting the right amount of sleep can
make a big difference in a person's life
today I'm going to talk to you about how
much sleep a person really needs and why
we need sleep so before you go to bed
tonight this that might come to mind
about what time you want to fall asleep
at and wake up back just to be getting
the right amount of sleep so you might
be wondering right now how much sleep do
we really need well sleep requirements
varied by individuals asleep
foundation.org of 2017 recommends a
falling sleep requirements adults need
seven to eight hours of sleep at night
whereas adolescents need ten hours there
are a few sleep inducing chemicals that
play a part in our sleeping the rise in
sleep induced chemicals such as Addison
and melatonin puts a person into a light
sleep making our breathing and our heart
rate slowed down as well as our muscles
to relax
this is when DNA is repaired and our
body is refreshed happening during the
non-rapid eye movement or REM sleep you
may be thinking why do we need sleep and
so much of it well here's a few pointers
that will change your mind about the
importance of sleep so why do we need
sleep sleeping comes with physical and
mental
get benefits for example sleeping is a
building process it restores the body's
energy supplies that have been depleted
through our daily activities getting the
right amount of sleep our body rebuilt
and restores our muscles that we have by
secreting a growth hormone nbcnews.com
of 2013 says spending all day long
thinking and creating takes up a lot of
our mental energy when we sleep we
restore our mental energy to just like
our phones you can be plugged in to
reach their full amount of battery at
the end of the day we need to be
recharged as well
Liz Miller the director of Bethel Health
Services stresses constant sleep
deprivation will greatly affect your
ability to retain information which
affects your grades which then leads to
stress along with several other harmful
consequences that David wolf of 2017
states for example one sleep deprivation
causes you to become more aggressive
deterring your interpersonal responses
and making you get upset easily secondly
it also weakens your immune system
causing you to have a higher risk of
catching a cold or an illness it will
cause you to gain weight by raising
levels of a bio chemical called ghrelin
an appetite stimulant lack of sleep will
increase type 2 diabetes and raise your
blood pressure not getting enough sleep
can impair your brain activity by
blocking neuron production which
increases to stress levels
sleep deprivation leads to memory loss
by deteriorating the brain and lastly
getting the proper amount of sleep will
increase risk of cancer now that you are
a more awake when it comes to sleeping
you now know about how much sleep is
enough and why we need to sleep and as
you can see getting the right amount of
sleep can make a big difference in a
person's life
overall getting a good night rest is the
right thing to do in order to be
successful and succeed as a college
student sleep is not an option it is of
extreme importance make it a priority

Six behaviors to increase your confidence,10-08-2022,Emily Jaenson,"when i was in high school my mom asked
me to order a pizza for the family on a
friday night
i looked up the phone number in the
phone book and promptly handed the phone
to my older brother to place the call i
was too shy to talk to a stranger
fast forward to college at the
university of illinois
my first time away from my small town i
spent the first several weeks crying in
my dorm room too homesick to partake in
early freshman partying
the one frat party i did attend was so
disappointing i wanted to trade in my
books abandon my major and head back
home to my small town
the confident behaviors i needed to
pursue this stream were not yet
available and when i looked around at
the confident students walking around me
around campus heads held high pursuing a
dream that they had set out to achieve i
wanted that kind of confidence too but
my behaviors did not align with these
confident attitudes crying in my dorm
room shying away from social engagement
not showing up for class because i was
worried others were smarter than me
these were not going to lead me to
achieve my goal so i knew is that i
needed to change
research tells us that in order to get
people to change you need to not start
with the attitudes but with the
behaviors associated with those
attitudes when people can see themselves
behaving differently they get then begin
to act differently so the questions for
me were
who am i
who do i want to become
and how does this person i want to
become behave
the answers were that i wanted a
successful career one that meant
something allowed me to contribute and
for me that was defined as a career as a
sports executive
in order to achieve this goal i needed
to begin to act more confidently
and i did
because 13 years later i became the
first female general manager of a triple
a baseball team in nearly 20 years
thank you
i also went on to host the leadership is
female podcast where i've interviewed
over 90 female executives in sports an
industry that's over 80 percent male at
management level and above
and time after time these women have
told me that the number one skill
they've improved in order to earn their
spot at the top of the sports industry
is confidence
they like me did not possess this
confidence necessary to increase their
level in their career from the get-go
they had to work on the behaviors
associated with this attitude in order
to propel their career forward
so i'm here today to share with you six
behaviors you can start today to
increase your confidence
why is it important to increase our
confidence well think of this
how would you behave or what could you
achieve if you were 10 times more
confident
number one count yourself in
i spoke with a woman about her first
time doing sideline reporting at a
nationally televised basketball game she
was shaking in her heels standing
courtside nerves overtaking her until
she heard something familiar in her
headset
we'll be on in five
and three two one
you're live
and she performed with excellence the
nerves melting away
she's an athlete a former basketball
player used to performing on the court
by the clock and the tactic remain true
counting will get you started and
momentum will keep you going
i have used this technique i've had more
uncomfortable conversations than i care
to recall but one i'll share with you
today i vividly remember standing on the
warning track of the baseball field 45
minutes before game time looking at the
opposing manager and his team wearing
the wrong color uniform i wanted to turn
and run back up to my office and hide
but instead i faced him head on
and i said in my mind three two one go
and i started walking towards him
and when i arrived we had a very
uncomfortable conversation about his
team wearing the wrong color uniform yes
i had asked these grown men to change
their clothes it was so awkward but when
i asked myself who am i and how do i
behave the answer was that i'm a person
who's not too shy to to stand up for
what i believe
what is right and stand up to conflict
counting got me started and momentum
kept me going
number two
what if you only had to be brave for a
total of 20 seconds
give yourself 20 seconds of courage
this behavior helped me enormously when
i published my podcast leadership is
female
bold title and all for all the world to
see hear critique and have their
opinions i vividly remember sitting on
the carpet of my closet floor
holding my computer looking at the
upload button thinking to myself
does it need any more edits should i
listen to it one more time
and i told myself emily give yourself 20
seconds of courage
and i hit publish and it was done and
guess what i kept breathing and the
world kept turning and the podcast grew
into what it was meant to be all because
of 20 seconds of courage
number three take a seat at the table
not metaphorically speaking
actually take a seat at the table
i spoke with a woman who represents some
of the biggest names in baseball and she
told me a story about taking a seat at
the table
she noticed women waiting around the
edges of the room waiting for the seats
to be filled and worse yet she was doing
it too
in order to become the more confident
woman that she envisioned herself to be
she needed to go in sit down speak her
mind and get the deal done that started
with one simple action
taking a seat at the table
number four
cheer for other people's success
they say that women will pull up the
ladder behind them what if you didn't
what if you extended a hand back to lead
her forward what if you celebrated the
success of a colleague rather than
feeling sorry for yourself that it was
not you accepting the accolades
confident people celebrate the success
of others rather than feeling threatened
think of this great quote from amy
poehler
good for her
not for me
it turns that pit in your stomach of oh
she did that and i'm still here into yes
good for her
not for me this is her celebration not
mine and when my time comes isn't it
going to be great to have the support of
so many people around me
wins are so much better celebrated
together
join in cheer someone else on
here's number four in action
recently a woman was promoted to chief
marketing officer of a major sports
league
the offer to interview and ultimately
land the job came after her public
celebration in sincere congratulatory
outreach to the newly named female
league president
confident people support those around
them cheer for someone else's success
number five
bolster your confidence for a new
activity through your already great
performance in another
what are you really good at
what is easier today than it was one
year ago
what is your most proud accomplishment
answer those questions think about those
answers those answers is where your
confidence is born
confidence is born in all we've already
done
and already achieved
recently a woman i interviewed on the
leadership as female podcast was going
after a big
big promotion at a top team
before she went in to pitch her boss she
reviewed her current job description
made notes of her accolades in all areas
mentioned and then was prepared with the
examples and the confidence of the
success she had in the past she got the
promotion
use your prior success to propel
yourself forward
and number six
celebrate
constantly
how often do we reach our goals and then
just immediately move on
when we do this the recollection of that
success is diminished
how can we
confidently move forward if we can't
remember what we achieved or worse yet
link that accomplishment to stress
find ways to celebrate that are

Steve Jobs introduces iPhone in 2007,09-01-2007,Steve Jobs,"this is a day
i've been looking forward to for two and
a half years
[Applause]
every once in a while
a revolutionary product comes along
that changes everything
and
apple has been
well first of all one's very fortunate
if you get to work on just one of these
in your career
apple's been very fortunate
it's been able to
introduce a few of these into the world
1984
we introduced the macintosh
it didn't just change apple
it changed the whole computer industry

in 2001
we introduced the first ipod
and
it didn't just
it didn't just change the way we all
listen to music
it changed the entire music industry
well
today
we're introducing
three
revolutionary products of this class
the first one
is a widescreen ipod with touch controls

the second
is a revolutionary mobile phone

and the third
is a breakthrough internet
communications device

so
three things
a widescreen ipod with touch controls
a revolutionary mobile phone
and a breakthrough internet
communications device
an ipod
a phone
and an internet communicator
an
ipod a phone
are you getting it
these are not
three separate devices
this is one device

and we are calling it
iphone
today
today apple is going to reinvent the
phone
and here it is
[Laughter]
no
actually here it is but we're going to
leave it there for now
so
before we get into it
let me uh
let me talk about a category of things
the most advanced phones are called
smartphones
so they say
and uh they typically combine a phone
plus some email capability plus they say
it's the internet sort of the baby
internet into one device and they all
have these plastic little keyboards on
them uh and the problem is
that they're not so smart
and they're not so easy to use so
if you kind of make a
you know business school 101 graph with
a smart access and the easy to use
access phones regular cell phones are
kind of right there they're not so smart
and they're you know not so easy to use
but smartphones are definitely a little
smarter but they actually are harder to
use they're really complicated just for
the basic stuff people have a hard time
figuring out how to use them
well we don't want to do either one of
these things
what we want to do is make a leapfrog
product
that is way smarter than any mobile
device has ever been and super easy to
use this is what iphone is
okay
so
we're going to reinvent the phone
now we're going to start

with a revolutionary user interface
is
the result of years of research and
development
and of course it's an interplay of
hardware and software
now
why do we need a revolutionary user
interface i mean here's four smartphones
right motorola q the blackberry palm
treo nokia e62 the usual suspects
and
what's wrong with their user interfaces
well the problem with them is really
sort of in the bottom 40 there
it's it's this stuff right here
they all have these keyboards that are
there whether you need them or not to be
there
and they all have these control buttons
that are fixed in plastic and are the
same for every application well every
application wants a slightly different
user interface a slightly optimized set
of buttons just for it
and what happens if you think of a great
idea six months from now you can't run
around and add a button to these things
they're already shipped
so what do you do
it doesn't work because the buttons and
the controls can't change they can't
change for each application and they
can't change
down the road if you think of another
great idea you want to add to this
product
well how do you solve this
it turns out we have solved it we solved
it in computers 20 years ago
we solved it with a bitmap screen
that could display anything we want put
any user interface up
and a pointing device we solved it with
the mouse
right
we solved this problem so how are we
going to take this to a mobile device
well what we're going to do is get rid
of all these buttons
and just make a giant screen
a giant screen
now
how are we going to communicate this we
don't want to carry around a mouse right
so what are we going to do
oh a stylist right we're going to use a
stylus
no
now
who wants a stylist
you have to get them and put them away
and you lose them yuck
nobody wants a stylus so let's not use a
stylus
we're going to use the best pointing
device in the world we're going to use a
pointing device that we're all born with
we're born with ten of them we're gonna
use our fingers
we're gonna touch this with our fingers
and we have invented a new technology
called multi-touch
which is phenomenal
it works like magic
you don't need a stylus
it's far more accurate than any touch
display that's ever been shipped
it ignores unintended touches it's super
smart
you can do multi-finger gestures on it
and boy have we patented it
so
so
we've been very lucky
to have brought a few revolutionary user
interfaces to the market in our time
first was the mouse
the second
was the click wheel and now
we're going to bring multi-touch to the
market
and each of these revolutionary user
interfaces has made possible
a revolutionary product the mac the ipod
and now the iphone
so a revolutionary user interface we're
going to build on top of that
with software now software on mobile
phones
is like
it's like baby software
it's not so powerful
and today
we're going to show you a software
breakthrough software that's at least
five years ahead of what's on any other
phone now how do we do this well we
start
with a strong foundation
iphone runs os 10.

now
why
why would we want to run such a
sophisticated operating system on a
mobile device well because it's got
everything we need
it's got multitasking it's got the best
networking it already knows how to power
manage we've been doing this on mobile
computers for years it's got awesome
security and the right apps
it's got everything from coco and the
graphics and it's got core animation
built in and it's got the audio and
video that os 10 is famous for it's got
all the stuff we want and it's built
right in to iphone and that has let us
create desktop class applications and
networking
right
not the crippled stuff that you find on
most phones this is real desktop class
applications
now you know
one of the pioneers of our industry
allen k has had a lot of great quotes
throughout the years and i ran across
one of them recently
that explains how we look at this
explains why we go about doing things
the way we do because we love software
and here's the quote
people who are really serious about
software should make their own hardware
you know
alan said this 30 years ago
and this is how we feel about it and so
we're bringing breakthrough software to

Use Laziness To Your Advantage,30-09-2020,Better Than Yesterday,"I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring this video.
Let's be honest.
We're all lazy to some extent.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
It's natural.
However, most of the time, it's those exact moments of laziness that make us overindulge

on our bad habits.
You see, when we feel motivated, it's quite easy to do the things we want to do, even
if we find them difficult otherwise.
But when we're feeling stressed, tired, lazy or when we've had a long day, we don't quite

posses that enthusiasm to do something that requires effort.
This is why on those lazy days, we usually do whatever is most convenient or easy, whatever
that might be.
And generally that's our default behavior.
In technology, default means the way something works when you start using it.
For example, when you buy a new phone, the settings are already set for you.
You get a default ringtone, a preset wallpaper, etc..
And unless you change those settings, default is what you're stuck with.
Now it's similar with our habits.
We all have certain behaviors that we adapted to, that are standard to us.
They have become our default and we tend to perform them almost on auto-pilot.
Those behaviors could be positive like: reading or learning new skills.
Or they could be something negative like: smoking cigarettes and scrolling through social
media all day.
Now, instead of accepting all of our behaviors as defaults, we should re-examine the ones
that are not serving us. Just like we can change our ringtone, we can also adjust our behavior.

And we can use our lazy nature to our advantage here.
All we need to do is utilize The 20 Second Rule.
In his book ""The Happiness Advantage"", Shawn Achor describes his own struggle with behavior change.

Shawn had a very clear goal.
He wanted to practice his guitar more often, while reducing the amount of time he spent

watching TV.
However he encountered a problem that many of us do, whenever we want to change our behavior.

Simply telling himself that he'll do it, wasn't enough for him to actually do it.
His guitar stayed in the closet, and watching TV remained his default go-to option.

Shawn recognized that he needed to disrupt his default behavior somehow, otherwise nothing
would change.
So he started looking for a solution.
He realized that every time he wanted to play his guitar, he had to first go in the closet,

get the guitar case out, and only once he got the guitar out of its case, could he actually play.

This all took roughly 20 seconds, but even this minimal effort that was required, seemed

to be enough to deter Shawn from playing.
After he became aware of this, he decided to move the guitar out of the closet, and
put it on a guitar stand, in the living room instead.
Now, whenever he wanted to play, he didn't have to search around the closet any longer.

The guitar was already out of its case, and he was able to pick it up and start practicing,
without having to exert too much effort.
Shawn also applied a similar tweak to his TV habit.
This time what he did was, he took the batteries out of the remote control and moved them to
a drawer in another room.
The next few nights, when he got home from work and by default jumped on the couch to
watch TV, he noticed that something was wrong.
He kept pressing the ON button, on the remote, forgetting that he removed the batteries.
Now, Shawn didn't didn't feel like getting up and retrieving the batteries from the other
room, as this would take extra effort.
So instead he picked up and played his guitar, which was conveniently within an arm's reach.

This slight intervention allowed him to disrupt his default behavior.
And as days passed, his urge to watch TV decreased, and playing the guitar started to feel more

and more natural.
Shawn decided to call this behavioral approach: The 20 Second Rule.
Essentially what he did was, he made playing the guitar 20 seconds easier, while making
watching TV 20 seconds harder.
And this strategy can be applied to pretty much any behavior you want to change.
Of course, 20 seconds is just a suggestion and not an absolute number.
In some cases, more than 20 seconds could be required, while in other cases it could
be less than 20.
The point is to lessen the barriers between activities you want to do more often, by making
it more convenient for yourself to do them.
While on the flip side, increase the obstacles between activities you want to stop participating
in, by making them more difficult to start.
I know that this might sound simple and intuitive, but many of us don't utilize this.

Which is a shame, since our surroundings are a huge contributing factor when it comes to
our behavior.
You see, usually the most difficult part of any behavior is getting started.
And the more activation energy an activity requires, the less likely you are to start,

especially if you're feeling tired or lazy.
When I say activation energy, I mean the amount of effort you need to exert, before you can
begin something.
So for example, watching TV usually takes very little activation energy.
You just have to get the remote, jump on the couch, and you're set.
Not much effort is required.
Now when it comes to working out, a little more activation energy is needed to begin.
However, if you really think about it, lifting weights isn't that difficult.
Sure, it's not as easy as laying on the couch, but the activity itself is not really that grueling.

What really turns you off, is the fact that you have so many steps to go through, before
you can begin working out.
First you need to get your gym bag ready, put on your shoes, then you need to drive
to the gym, change your clothes, and so on and so forth.
There's so many inconveniences standing in the way.
But if you could skip some of those steps, or at least make them more tolerable, working
out would become much easier, as there would be less activation energy required.

And it's the same with pretty much any other activity.
When it comes down to it, most of the activities aren't that difficult to do, they just require
a little more effort for you to get started.
But once you do start and get settled in, it's always very easy to continue, even if
you don't necessarily find the activity as fun.
So if you're able to lower the activation energy required to begin a certain behavior,
your chances of doing what you want to do, increase exponentially.
And this is especially important because, even if you enjoy doing something, but there's
a lot of friction in the way before you can begin, you're more likely to skip it and go

do something easier instead.
For example, I love going for long bike rides.
It's one activity that always helps me unwind, especially if I'm feeling stressed or anxious.

However, there's one problem I encounter every single time I want to go cycling.

And that is the fact that I have to get my bike out of the basement first. The whole process

takes me exactly 3 minutes, but sometimes it's enough to discourage me from going on
that ride.
Logically this makes no sense.
Why would 3 minutes of preparation, deter me from doing something I know I enjoy?
But like I said, humans are quite lazy and we would rather do something that's easy and

convenient, instead of what we actually want to do.
For this simple reason, I'm sometimes stressed for the entire day.
This of course, could easily be avoided, by just going on that bike ride, which I know
I would enjoy and it would help me de-stress.
But at that moment, I would rather go for the default option, which is to spend my time
thinking about all the horrible scenarios that will never happen, instead of choosing
a slightly less convenient option, which would solve the problem.
I know all of this might sound silly, but it's just an example of how inconvenience
can dictate our actions.
By now, you probably understand how your surroundings affect your behavior, and you might even
have a few ideas about how you can use all this information to your advantage.
But just so you can get a better sense of it, here's a few common problems people face,
and how The 20 Second Rule can be applied to solve them.
If you want to exercise more often, make sure your gym is as close as possible.

Preferably somewhere on your route to work.
This way, you can stop there before you start your job, or afterwards when you're on your
way home.
If you have to drive 1 hour somewhere every time you want to workout, you'll be more likely
to skip it altogether as that's a huge barrier.
Plus you wanna make sure to get your gym bag ready ahead of time, or whatever else is necessary

for the workout of your choice.
This way when you're ready to exercise, you don't have to search and scramble around for
all the necessary gear.
Some people also like to sleep in their gym clothes, so when they wake up they are already set.

Basically they skip the dressing up part when they wake up, since usually in the morning,
they don't really feel like exercising.
But since they are already geared up, it's much easier to do so, because there's one
less barrier in the way.
If you have trouble eating healthy, simply throw out all the unhealthy food in your house.

This way, all that remains is healthy food.
When you're hungry and you don't feeling like cooking, of course you will eat whatever is
most convenient.
Usually that's something unhealthy, that's already been factory prepared.
But if there isn't anything unhealthy in your house, you now have to go out of your way
to get it.
And since there's this additional obstacle in the way, you're less likely to do so.

But if you're the type of person that would still go out and buy junk food, then consider
preparing some of your healthy meals in advance on a Sunday, and simply heat them up during
the week.
So now if the cravings hit, there is less activation energy required to eat a healthy
meal, as it's already waiting there for you.
Another common problem, that most don't even realize is a problem, is unintentional phone

use, when trying to work or study.
You most likely always have your phone somewhere near you, and you're able to start using it
whenever you want.
But most of the time you check the phone simply because you're looking for a way to escape
those 5 seconds of boredom and your phone is conveniently there.
For this exact reason, our phones have become anti-focus devices, as they take our attention

from whatever we should be doing.
Therefore, you should create a barrier by putting your phone in another room or somewhere
where you can't see or reach it.
If you actually need to use it for something important, you'll have to get up and get it.
And you'll most likely realize that you don't need to check your phone as often as you do now.
Of course, many people need to use their phone or computer for work, therefore they aren't
able to simply hide it somewhere.
But they can still modify the software on their devices.
If you have trouble with constant social media use, simply delete all the apps or move them

to a folder somewhere, so they're harder to access.
Instead make your homescreen work related.
Again, this creates a barrier between unintentional social media use, since you can't access it

with one simple click any more.
And at the same time, it makes your work related stuff easier to use.
The same can be applied for your computer use, by separating work from play.
You do this by creating two different users, one that is optimized for work, and another
one that is optimized for fun.
This way when it's time to work, you're actually working and you're not stuck browsing random
websites or playing video games.
Likewise, when you want to relax, you don't have anything to remind you of work, and you
can fully unwind.
Ok, these are just a few examples of how you could increase or decrease activation energy,

but there are many more options.
You will need to think about your own situation and see where you can make some changes.
The 20 second rule probably won't work all the time, but it will make your behavior more
intentional, rather than default.
Sure, there will be days when you really want to watch TV, so get up and grab the batteries
from the other room.
Just like there will be days when I'll have no problem getting my bike from the basement.
The point is to become aware of your default behaviors and be in control of them, rather
than being left at the mercy of whatever is most convenient in the moment.
That is why I encourage you to examine your surroundings and think about where you could
add or reduce 20 seconds of activation energy.
Remember, starting is always the most difficult part.
So make your desired actions easy to start, while making your unwanted actions difficult.

This will allow you to become the master of your own behavior.
Now, I want to make one activity easier for you.
And that is learning.

Why Gravity is NOT a Force,09-10-2020,Veritasium,"This video is sponsored by Caseta by Lutron

According to the general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force.
There are no gravitational fields, gravity is kind of an illusion.

And in this video, I will prove it to you by blasting off into outer space in 321

Albert Einstein said the happiest thought of his life
was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house.
What made Einstein so happy about this wasn't Schadenfreude,
It was the realization that this man, while he was falling wouldn't feel his own weight.

He would be weightless and anything he dropped on his way down,
Well, it would remain stationary relative to him or moving in uniform motion.

The whole situation would be just like..

If you were in deep space, not near any large masses.

With your spaceship at rest or coasting along at constant velocity

Here, you would feel no weight
Objects would remain stationary relative to you or if you give them a push, they would move in a straight line at constant velocity

And you would be the very definition of an inertial observer,
you're not accelerating, not in a gravitational field,
all the laws of physics apply in your reference frame,
meaning there is no experiment, you could do to distinguish your initial reference frame from any other

Now here comes the big leap:
Einstein looks at these two scenarios and says they are equivalent, not just similar

Physically, they are exactly the same thing.
Which means man falling from roof is not in a gravitational field.
There are no gravitational fields, and he is not accelerating.
He is an inertial observer, just like Rocket Man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I mean, okay, I can see how both of these observers feel weightless.

But man falling from roof is clearly in a gravitational field.
I mean, he's right next to the Earth.
And he's obviously accelerating his speed is increasing by 9.8 meters per second, every second

A fact that will become painfully apparent when he crashes into the ground.
I know that these two situations look very different,
but Einstein's equivalence principle tells us the one thing to focus on: the experience of the observer.

If they feel weightless than they are in an inertial frame of reference
every bit as good as rocket man's out drifting through deep space.
Imagine if Rocket Man coasting along at constant velocity
and not paying attention comes upon a planet a long way off in the distance.

An external observer might notice that the path of the rocket bends ever so slightly towards the planet.

But inside, Rocket Man would remain oblivious.
He feels no force, experiences no acceleration
As the rocket gets closer to the planet, it goes faster and faster
But Rocket Man still feels weightless. For him, nothing has changed.
So where on this journey would you say the frame of reference changes from inertial to non inertial?
An onboard accelerometer would never even register a blip.
He has continued on his inertial path through spacetime
So the logical conclusion is his frame of reference is inertial up until the instant he crashes into the planet.

Okay, so how do you explain the curved path of his rocket without gravitational forces or gravitational fields?

The answer is curved spacetime.
First focus on rocket man's observation that the whole time he felt like he was moving with constant velocity in a straight line.

He was moving in a straight line through spacetime
but space time around massive objects, like planets is curved.
So that's why his path appeared curved to a distant observer.
Now this isn't as unusual as it seems,
Airplanes, for example, always try to fly the shortest route between cities.
Essentially, they just go in a straight line.
But since the Earth's surface is curved, the shortest path doesn't look like a straight line.

These shortest paths over curved surfaces are called geodesics,
and we use that same word, geodesics,
for the straight line paths followed by inertial observers through curved space time
Here's another analogy.
Imagine you and a friend are standing 1000 kilometers apart on the equator.

Now you both set off due North.
Over time you will come closer together.
Ultimately bumping into each other at the North Pole.
It?s as though there was a force pushing you together, but you didn't feel a force and your friend didn't feel a force.\n

Gravity is just like that force, it doesn't actually exist.

The real reason for you coming together was that you were both on straight paths, geodesics, on a curved surface.

Astronauts on the space station are weightless.
That means they too are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic
But the earth curves space time around it, which is why their straight line path appears as a helix.

It only looks like a circular orbit if you forget the time dimension.
Don't forget, we are all moving through space and time, spacetime

This is the standard bent sheet analogy for curved space time,
but I think this demo is misleading.
It allows you to fool yourself into thinking you understand general relativity
when the intuition you're actually drawing on is just that objects like to fall towards the middle of a well due to the gravitational force.

But in general relativity, there is no gravitational force.
What you should be thinking about is objects traveling on a straight line path through spacetime

It just so happens that spacetime is curved around massive objects,
so that straight line path doesn't look like a straight line.
Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move.

Now let's go back to deep space.
What happens if you turn on the rocket thrusters and accelerate at 9.8 meters per second squared?

Well, someone outside would see all objects remain stationary, while the floor of the rocket accelerates into them.

Inside the rocket, everything would appear to accelerate down to the ground
and you would feel a force pushing up on your feet,
the same force that's pushing up on you as you watch this video.

This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on the surface of Earth.

Cause we are at rest on the surface of Earth.
I want to ask you, are you watching this video in an inertial frame of reference?

Well, I mean, do you feel weightless?
No, so you are not an inertial observer.
Your situation is exactly the same as someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space.

And let me be clear,
I don't mean the being at rest and a gravitational field is like accelerating and a rocket.
I mean, it is the exact same thing.
You are accelerating and there is no gravitational field.
Gravitational fields do not exist.
Now I know that sounds crazy, but come with me for a minute.

This is you.
in standard Newtonian physics we draw your weight force, the force of gravity pushing you down

and the normal force from the floor pushing you up.
We say these forces are equal and opposite, so there's no net force on you, so you are not accelerating.

But in general relativity, gravity is not a force.
You have no weight.
So the only force on you are these normal forces pushing you up.
So you are accelerating upwards.
But I'm not moving up!
Relative to what?
I mean, relative to the flip chart and the floor and basically everything in this room.
But all of those things are in your frame of reference, which you know is not inertial.

Relative to everything in my rocket ship, I'm not accelerating.

What you need if you really want to measure your acceleration is someone in an inertial frame of reference,

like the guy who fell off the roof
And he would see you accelerating up at 9.8 meters per second squared.

I think what this shows is that what an acceleration really is is it's a deviation from a geodesic

You can't follow a straight line path through space time because the floor prevents you from doing that:

it applies a force upwards on you, so you're accelerating up.
But if I'm accelerating up and so is everyone else around the world
and presumably the whole surface of the Earth,
Then, shouldn't the earth be expanding?
No. It is possible for you to be accelerating, even though your spatial coordinates are not changing.

I will show you one equation from general relativity
This says that the second derivative of your position with respect to time
is equal to your acceleration, that's just f on m,
And if you were in flat spacetime, well, this is exactly what you're saying
if you're accelerating your spatial coordinates have to change.
But you're not in flat space time, and this term is related to the curvature of spacetime

and this is your velocity through time squared.
You don't have to worry about the details here, the point is your position can be not changing.

This can be zero, which means your acceleration must be exactly equal to

this curvature term times are velocity through time squared.
So in curved spacetime, you need to accelerate just to stand still.

A lot of this may seem more complicated than Newtonian physics,
but one classical mystery looks a whole lot simpler in general relativity,

which is why all objects fall at the same rate.

Now I have made a number of videos on this topic
and I would always give the standard Newtonian explanation:
the only force on a free falling body is its weight g m m on r squared,
which equals its mass times acceleration.
You can cancel the objects mass on both sides of the equation.
Hence, all objects will have this same acceleration.
The mystery is why we could cancel these two m's,
the one on the left was gravitational mass, the property of an object that creates and experiences a gravitational field.

While the m on the right is inertial mass, a measure of resistance to acceleration.

Why should these two conceptually different properties be numerically identical?

Scientists have spent a lot of time and effort experimentally testing
down to around one part in 10 trillion that these two types of mass really are the same.

But in general relativity, there is no mystery.
All objects appear to fall the same way because they're not accelerating.
They're just following straight line pass through spacetime until they encounter something that stops them.

Like the objects in the rocket ship, they appear to accelerate at the same rate
because they're not really accelerating.
It's the floor accelerating into them.
Now, a lot of us might seem pretty far fetched
as it did back in 1915 when Einstein proposed it
So he very cleverly came up with a measurable prediction that scientists could make to test his theory.

Imagine that this rocket ship is coasting through deep space
If you shine a light beam across the rocket ship, well it'll do exactly what you expect:

light travels in a straight line and hits a point on the opposite wall at exactly the same height as the source.

But now what if this rocket is accelerating?
Well, to an external observer, they're still going to see the same thing: light traveling in a straight line,

but inside the rocket, during the time it takes the light to travel across the cabin, The rocket will have sped up.

So by the time it hits the other wall, it'll hit a little lower than before.

So in an accelerating frame of reference light deflects down

Here I'm dramatically exaggerating the effect,
even if I were accelerating up at 10 G's, which would probably kill me,
the deflection would be on the order of the width of a proton.
Still, it shows that an accelerating frame of reference will bend light.

So Einstein reasoned light must also bend when it passes a large mass

But where do you find a mass large enough?
Well, the only obvious huge mass near the Earth is the sun.

So the ideal experiment would be to look at light passing just next to the sun and see if it is deflected.

Say light from distant stars.
The problem was, of course, the sun is just so bright, you can't see stars right next to it.
Unless there is a total solar eclipse, which is exactly what happened in 1919

So Arthur Eddington set out to take pictures of the stars right next to the sun during totality.

And what he found by analyzing those pictures,
was that their positions appeared deflected by the precise amount predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity

The result was twice the deflection some had calculated using a strictly Newtonian model

And general relativity has passed virtually every test put to it over the past hundred years or so,

but there are still more things to try

A well known and empirically validated finding is that accelerating charges radiates electromagnetic radiation.

So one conceptually simple experimental test
would be to compare the behavior of a stationary charge and a gravitational field to a free falling one

If a more Newtonian picture of gravity is correct,
well then the stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation,
but a free falling one is accelerating and therefore it should radiate.
In contrast, general relativity sees the free-falling charge as non accelerating.

It's just going on a straight line path through curve space time,
whereas the stationary charge is accelerating and therefore it should give off electromagnetic radiation.

Now, thus far logistical challenges have prevented anyone from actually carrying out this experiment,

but what you believe will happen reveals what you truly think about the nature of gravity.

Do you think that a freely falling charge will radiate electromagnetic radiation or not?

Is gravity an illusion?

This episode was sponsored by Caseta
and so I used the sponsorship money to have a rocket ship built

Caseta by Lutron makes these smart light switches in the rocket ship.
They also make remotes, motion sensors, smart plugs,
basically every smart switch you could use for turning things in your home on and off
But installing a smart switch isn't rocket science.
You just turn off the power to the switch, detach the existing wires,
and reconnect them to the Caseta smart switch.
What's great about smart switches, as opposed to smart bulbs, is one switch often controls multiple bulbs.

So you can save money by replacing only the switch.
And they connect to most smart devices like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple home kit.

And you can control them via an app on your phone.
So if you forget to turn off the lights and the rocket, no need to go back, just turn them off in the app.

You can also use the app to set up schedules, turning the lights on when it goes dark.
This gives you peace of mind knowing your family will always come home to a well lit house.
Now we may not have personal rockets yet, but we have smart switches
and the smart choice for these devices is Caseta by Lutron.",Informative
The Most Beautiful Equation in Math,15-03-2016,Carnegie Mellon University,"I want to share the most beautiful equation in math with you, okay
So [actually] this is literally if you search google the most beautiful equation in math. Yeah, you will find it

So this thing I might need to use a little bit of the board
I'll just write this pi we already know what Pi is right. There's another number in math, which is called I

This is the square root of -1, so somehow I
Equal to the square root of -1 which you're not allowed to do
There's no way you can multiply two numbers together and get a negative one
Well there is if you allow what are called complex numbers, or imaginary numbers?
So that's this I you can multiply those two together you can get even more crazy number, not only something doesn't end

but it's not even a real number, but there's another number in math also, and that number is called ""e"" and

""e"" appears on a lot of these scientific calculators, ""e"" is another number
which is just like Pi in the sense that it's
Transcendental doesn't stop anywhere and also there isn't uh... there isn't a very nice way to express what it is. So this one goes by

2.71828
And so on actually this number is also quite impressive. it's one eight two eight one eight two eight

45 90
45 and more digits Beyond there okay, so a bunch of nice numbers, but this ""e"" actually comes also somewhere else in Mathematics

Even though I told you this doesn't have sent any nicer
Repeating decimal or even terminating decimal with ""e"", you can get ""e"" by saying suppose
I have a box of chocolates with a hundred chocolates
And I [drop] them all on the ground and I tried to put them all [back] in this is like these nice chocolates
But everything's different right you can ask like what's the probability that every chocolate went back in the wrong spot

And that probability becomes very close to 1 over ""e""
That's this and the more chocolates you have the closer it is to this anyway three crazy numbers

It turns out that if you take ""e"" and raise it to that

then I can finish the equation with two more numbers like the most basic numbers in Math Are 1 and [0] and

This is true
So what's going on? Here is I've just put together 3 completely ridiculous numbers and they together make negative 1

For all of the of the nest that was here because all come back in together right here
And this is this is a this is an avis called Euler's identity

and
[it] is actually [the] most beautiful equation in math because it combines all of these different constants together

There's your [pi] there, but suddenly the pi got joined with all these other ones
So there's some other other other fun parts here - have you seen this is the shirts with the PI and the [I] the joke

where Pi says
Get real and I says be rational right there
They're basically calling each other out
So I seen those shirts ever since I was in [high] school of like the speech bubble get real be rational

It's like the pot calling the kettle black
but
Actually that should that shirt should have one more punch line the last punch line should be
Let me let me write the joke first this one says get real
And this one says be rational

the correct way to put the punchline on this joke is ""e"" should say join me and

and we'll be
one
so of course that's a
Negative one right there, but somehow this was this this punchline the joke was never said before and though

We thought of this joke about two years ago American it we have
We have already great t-shirts with it",Informative
The hardest problem on the hardest test,08-12-2017,3Blue1Brown,"Do you guys know about the Putnam? It's a math competition for undergraduate students.
It?s 6 hours long and consists of 12 questions, broken up into two different 3-hour sessions.

With each question being scored on a 1-10 scale, the highest possible score is 120.

And yet, despite the fact that the only students taking it each year are those who are clearly
already pretty into math, given that they opt into such a test, the median score tends
to be around 1 or 2. So... it?s a hard test. And on each section of 6 questions, the problems

tend to get harder as you go from 1 to 6, although of course difficulty is in the eye
of the beholder.
But the thing about the 5?s and 6?s is that even though they?re positioned as the
hardest problems on a famously hard test, quite often these are the ones with the most
elegant solutions available. Some subtle shift in perspective that transforms it from challenging

to simple. Here I?ll share with you one problem which
came up as the 6th question on one of these tests a while back.
And those of you who follow the channel know that rather than just jumping straight to
the solution, which in this case will be surprisingly short, when possible I prefer to take the
time to walk through how you might stumble upon the solution yourself.

That is, make the video more about the problem-solving process than the particular problem used to
exemplify it.
So here?s the question: If you choose 4 random points on a sphere, and consider the

tetrahedron which has these points as its vertices, what?s the probability that the

center of the sphere is inside the tetrahedron? Take a moment to kind of digest the question.

You might start thinking about which of these tetrahedra contain the sphere?s center,
which ones don?t, and how you might systematically distinguish the two.
And...how do approach a problem like this, where do you even start?
Well, it?s often a good idea to think about simpler cases, so let?s bring things down
into 2 dimensions.
Suppose you choose three random points on a circle. It?s always helpful to name things,

so let?s call these guys P1, P2, and P3. What?s the probability that the triangle

formed by these points contains the center of the circle?
It?s certainly easier to visualize now, but it?s still a hard question.

So again, you ask yourself if there?s a way to simplify what?s going on. We still
need a foothold, something to build up from. Maybe you imagine fixing P1 and P2 in place,

only letting P3 vary. In doing this, you might notice that there?s

special region, a certain arc, where when P3 is in that arc, the triangle contains the
circle?s center. Specifically, if you draw a lines from P1
and P2 through the center, these lines divide the circle into 4 different arcs. If P3 happens

to be in the one opposite P1 and P2, the triangle will contain the center. Otherwise, you?re

out of luck.
We?re assuming all points of the circle are equally likely, so what?s the probability

that P3 lands in that arc? It?s the length of that arc divided by the
full circumference of the circle; the proportion of the circle that this arc makes up.

So what is that proportion? This depends on the first two points.
If they are 90 degrees apart from each other, for example, the relevant arc is  of the
circle. But if those two points are farther apart, the proportion might be closer to .

If they are really close, that proportion might be closer to 0.
Alright, think about this for a moment. If P1 and P2 are chosen randomly, with every
point on the circle being equally likely, what?s the average size of the relevant

arc? Maybe you imagine fixing P1 in place, and

considering all the places that P2 might be. All of the possible angles between these two
lines, every angle from 0 degrees up to 180 degrees is equally likely, so every proportion

between 0 and 0.5 is equally likely, making the average proportion 0.25.

Since the average size of this arc is  this full circle, the average probability that

the third point lands in it is , meaning the overall probability of our triangle containing

the center is . Try to extend to 3D

Great! Can we extend this to the 3d case? If you imagine 3 of your 4 points fixed in

place, which points of the sphere can that 4th point be on so that our tetrahedron contains

the sphere?s center? As before, let?s draw some lines from each

of our first 3 points through the center of the sphere. And it?s also helpful if we
draw the planes determined by any pair of these lines.
These planes divide the sphere into 8 different sections, each of which is a sort of spherical

triangle. Our tetrahedron will only contain the center of the sphere if the fourth point

is in the section on the opposite side of our three points.

Now, unlike the 2d case, it?s rather difficult to think about the average size of this section
as we let our initial 3 points vary. Those of you with some multivariable calculus

under your belt might think to try a surface integral. And by all means, pull out some
paper and give it a try, but it?s not easy. And of course it should be difficult, this
is the 6th problem on a Putnam!
But let?s back up to the 2d case, and contemplate if there?s a different way of thinking about

it. This answer we got, , is suspiciously clean and raises the question of what that

4 represents. One of the main reasons I wanted to make a
video on this problem is that what?s about to happen carries a broader lesson for mathematical

problem-solving. These lines that we drew from P1 and P2 through
the origin made the problem easier to think about.
In general, whenever you?ve added something to your problem setup which makes things conceptually
easier, see if you can reframe the entire question in terms of the thing you just added.

In this case, rather than thinking about choosing 3 points randomly, start by saying choose

two random lines that pass through the circle?s center.
For each line, there are two possible points they could correspond to, so flip a coin for
each to choose which of those will be P1 and P2.

Choosing a random line then flipping a coin like this is the same as choosing a random
point on the circle, with all points being equally likely, and at first it might seem
needlessly convoluted. But by making those lines the starting point of our random process
things actually become easier. We?ll still think about P3 as just being

a random point on the circle, but imagine that it was chosen before you do the two coin

flips. Because you see, once the two lines and a
random point have been chosen, there are four possibilities for where P1 and P2 end up,

based on the coin flips, each one of which is equally likely. But one and only one of

those outcomes leaves P1 and P2 on the opposite side of the circle as P3, with the triangle

they form containing the center. So no matter what those two lines and P3 turned
out to be, it?s always a  chance that the coin flips will leave us with a triangle

containing the center. That?s very subtle. Just by reframing how

we think of the random process for choosing these points, the answer  popped in a different

way from before.
And importantly, this style of argument generalizes seamlessly to 3 dimensions.

Again, instead of starting off by picking 4 random points, imagine choosing 3 random

lines through the center, and then a random point for P4.

That first line passes through the sphere at 2 points, so flip a coin to decide which
of those two points is P1. Likewise, for each of the other lines flip a coin to decide where

P2 and P3 end up. There are 8 equally likely outcomes of these

coin flips, but one and only one of these outcomes will place P1, P2, and P3 on the

opposite side of the center from P4. So only one of these 8 equally likely outcomes

gives a tetrahedron containing the center. Isn?t that elegant?

This is a valid solution, but admittedly the way I?ve stated it so far rests on some

visual intuition. I?ve left a link in the description to a
slightly more formal write-up of this same solution in the language of linear algebra
if you?re curious. This is common in math, where having the key
insight and understanding is one thing, but having the relevant background to articulate
this understanding more formally is almost a separate muscle entirely, one which undergraduate

math students spend much of their time building up.
Lesson Now the main takeaway here is not the solution
itself, but how you might find the key insight if you were left to solve it. Namely, keep

asking simpler versions of the question until you can get some foothold, and if some added

construct proves to be useful, see if you can reframe the whole question around that
new construct.",Informative
Catholic vs Orthodox - What is the Difference Between Religions?,10-07-2021,The Infographics Show,"A guy and a girl meet in school.
They start up a conversation and the girl asks the guy, what religion are you?'.
He replies, ?Christian.?
She says, ?Me too.?
That conversation has likely happened millions of times since there are about 2.6 billion

Christians on this planet.
On top of that, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity said in 2021 that around
the world there is something like 45,000 Christian denominations.
Throughout history, there have been splits, and more splits, with different churches believing
different things.
It would be an understatement to say it?s complicated, so today we?ll just concentrate
on one great big split and what happened after that.
But first back to the start, and we don?t mean God getting busy building the universe
or Judas Iscariot giving his buddy away in the Garden of Gethsemane.
What we mean is when the church really started to have some legs.
That?s when the problems started.
After Jesus Christ died on the cross and was later resurrected, Christianity was rife throughout
the Roman Empire, although there was a fair bit of persecution going on.
Then in the year 313, Emperor Constantine made Christianity legal and in 380 it became

the state religion.
The Catholic Church says that it began with the teachings of Christ and all his disciples.
Those guys spread the word, and today people still spread the word.
There are people called bishops, and they are supposed to be like those old school disciples.
In part thanks to them, Christianity was soon everywhere.
As the centuries passed, more churches started popping up, although they didn?t really
become pervasive until the 11th century.
That?s when things got really heated.
All you need to know is that Christianity spread over vast areas of the world, but the
head guy, the Pope, was in Rome.
Even so, many Christians weren?t even close to Rome.
They were spread over other parts of Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Africa, and the Middle
East.
Those people were part of Eastern Christianity, but this only really refers to geography,
not beliefs and customs.
Now you need to understand two words: Catholic and Orthodox.
Catholic actually comes from the word ?universal?, so what it really means is universal Christianity.

Orthodox relates to following the correct beliefs, so if you?re orthodox you think
you?re just doing things the right way according to tradition and law.
Of course, no religious person is going to say I?m following the wrong beliefs.
And no person is going to say my religion is not a universal truth, otherwise, it?s
not really a religion.
In this sense, the semantic sense, all Christians are orthodox and Catholic, but that?s not

the point of this show.
Now we come to the big split, aka, the ?East-West Schism.?
This officially happened in 1054 and was the result of Eastern and Western Christianity
often not getting along politically, and having different opinions on how one should serve
Christ.
One historian, speaking in academic parlance, described the reason for the split like this.
The ?depths of intellectual alienation that had developed between the two sections of
Christendom.?
They had their differences and they broke up.
Nowadays the Eastern Orthodox Church is the second biggest church after the Roman Catholic
Church.
The pope is not their leader, instead, each different Orthodox church has a head bishop
who?s elected by all the other bishops in that church, and he becomes the patriarch,
or what?s called the Holy Synod.
There isn?t just one, though, in all Orthodox Christianity.
For instance, you have the Russian Holy Synod, the Greek Holy Synod, the Romanian Holy Synod
and more.
This is different from the Pope, who sits on the metaphorical throne and answers to
no one.
You also have the Patriarch of Constantinople on Orthodox Christianity, who?s kind of
the spiritual number one and the ?first among equals?, but he?s not like the Pope
in that he doesn?t hold sway over all the other patriarchs around the world.
He still holds a lot of respect, but then Russia has its own spiritual top man in the
Archbishop of Moscow.
In matters of doctrine, the Roman Pope is said to be infallible, meaning he doesn?t
get anything wrong.
The Orthodox church disagrees, saying even its own leaders can make mistakes.
Those leaders, by the way, are usually ordained monks before they become a patriarch.
Orthodox Christians are usually ok with priests being celibate or not being celibate, while
Catholics don?t allow priests to have intimate partners.
Celibacy is not a big deal for most Orthodox Churches.
The difference is not really a great issue.
A really big difference and the reason for centuries of disagreement is over these few
words: ?I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord,
the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
Who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.?
That?s talking about the Holy Trinity, which is the Holy Spirit, the Father and the Son.
This disagreement over this has been called the ?The Filioque fracas? with Filioque
relating to the Son.
It was actually one of the biggest reasons for the great breakup.
You see, those guys in the East said it was the Father and the Father alone that was behind
the Holy Spirit, and the Son wasn?t so involved.
They even said if you think any different, you?re a heretic.
Swords were drawn and they were never sheathed.
Still today the Son in the Orthodox Church won?t play such a starring role in proceeding
the Holy Spirit.
They say the Western Church shoehorned the Son into things by itself and that just wasn?t
right.
They preferred what they think is the original version of events told by the first theologians,
the Church Fathers.
Still, both churches agree that there is a Father up in heaven and a Son that came down
to Earth and also a Holy Spirit that is everywhere.
They just don?t agree on the relationship they have.
Ok, but why do they disagree and why do people today still argue for their side?
Let?s face it, it?s human nature to join a club and support it, and where you are born
usually determines which club you?ll be supporting.
Now you?ll see how each club has different ways of doing things, not just thinking things.
You are likely wondering what this seemingly intractable rupture means today?
If you mention the Son proceeding the Holy Spirit in say, Russia or Bulgaria, are you
liable to find yourself in a punch up?
We doubt it, but both sides do argue over certain things.
For instance, you might have seen Catholics making the sign of the cross on themselves,
such as soccer players before they take a penalty kick or mobsters when they?ve just
narrowly escaped a whacking.
You?ll notice that they make the beam of the cross from the left shoulder to the right
shoulder.
Orthodox Christians do it the other way around.
It might seem like a small deal, but it isn?t for some who believe they do it the correct
way.
We visited an Eastern Orthodox website to find out why there is a difference.
This is what we read, ?They [Catholics] must explain why they have changed an ancient
and apostolic tradition.
We cannot answer as to their motivations.?
Yet again, the Roman Catholic Church gets called out for doing things its own way and
not adhering to old-school thought and methods.
The Orthodox Church says it has preserved traditions etched in stone.
It pays more attention, or most people do, to rituals.
If you?re going to try and preserve traditions, then you really have to be strict about your
rituals.
Religion is by its very nature conservative, but one of the bigger differences is the Orthodox
Church is usually more conservative than the Catholic Church.
To give you an example, we looked at Pew Research studies on Orthodox feelings about homosexuality
and same-sex marriage.
In the majority of countries that are home to mostly Orthodox Christians, the vast majority
of people were against both.
Greece was the only country where quite a large ? not very large ? percentage of
people said homosexuality should be accepted by society.
The Catholic Church also calls homosexuality a sin, but there are still progressive elements
within the church, more so than in the Orthodox Church.
Just to give you an idea of how a certain church might think, one person wrote to a
Greek Orthodox Church in the US.
The question was, ?I am powerfully drawn to the Orthodox Church, but I?m gay.?
He asked if he could still join.
The answer was kind of yes, but with some caveats, such as this, ?A repentant, struggling
homosexual who refrains from homosexual acts can be received into the church after the
usual course of instruction, but he or she would do best to keep this matter in the confessional,

just as is common with every other sin.?
Of course, all people are different.
We like this response we found on another website when someone asked which church was
more conservative: ?Politically, Orthodox and Catholic Christians
are both all over the map.
You will find Orthodox Communists and Orthodox neo-fascists, but also Orthodox peaceniks

and the like.
Same goes for Catholics.?
Still, some things are just different and they always will be.
Take Easter for example, which for many people will be how this deceased American comedian
explained it: ?Commemorating the death and resurrection of Jesus by telling our children
a giant bunny rabbit left chocolate eggs in the night.?
He was actually referring to Catholics or Protestants and not members of the Orthodox
Church.
They are deadly serious when it comes to the resurrection.
In both churches, Easter can fall on different days of the year, but the days will still
be different for both churches.
The reason is because of a man named Pope Gregory XIII.
In 1582, he made a change to the calendar and that?s why when you look at your phone,
you?re looking at the Gregorian calendar.
The Orthodox Church bases the days of Easter on the Julian calendar, which relates to Julius
Caesar.
Again, they are sticking with tradition since the Julian calendar preceded the Gregorian
calendar.
They are also a lot stricter about Easter.
They start fasting on Clean Monday and do it for 40 days until it ends on Lazarus Saturday
eight days before Easter.
This fasting period is called the Great Lent.
When that?s over, they might chow down on roasted lamb, or traditional soups and cakes,
but not so much sickly Cadbury?s Cream Eggs that were hidden in pairs of running shoes.
The fasting part for Orthodox Christians is a huge deal, since it relates to important
matters such as purification, enlightening yourself, and liberating yourself from sin.
In short, it shows a certain amount of dedication.
Catholics may fast too, but only on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and other Fridays during Lent.
The truth is, Catholics are more likely not to follow fasting rules than Orthodox folks.
As a matter of fact, members of the Orthodox Church are supposed to fast every Wednesday
and Friday throughout the year, and many will take this seriously.
Catholics should also fast every Friday, but many or most don?t.
As for what fasting requires, well, that changes for different people.
Some people are stricter than others.
It often means one meal a day with no meat, plus you might lay off the dairy and booze,
among other things.
For some Catholics, it might mean staying off Facebook for the day.
The meaning of Easter for both churches is a bit different, too.
In both cases, Christ was crucified and then resurrected, but the Catholics put great emphasis
on JC suffering for our sins.
That?s why he?s usually depicted covered in blood.
There?s no blood in Orthodox renditions.
For the Orthodox Church, the emphasis of the resurrection is more about Christ?s victory,
his triumph over dark forces.
If Catholics see it as Jesus taking a hit for our sins, which is a bit depressing in
a way, the Orthodox folks see it as Jesus kicking some butt.
This might seem like a small difference, but it?s not when it comes to celebrations.
For the Orthodox Church, Easter is like celebrating D-Day, but for the Catholics, it?s more
like shamefully looking up and saying, thanks dude for having my back.
There are some other differences, big and small.
A small one might be that people of the Orthodox Church are more likely to stand up while praying.
It?s not demanded by any means, but it happens more.
Again it?s down to the interpretation of God?s word and reverence to God.
That is not a big deal, but what is a serious matter is what happens after death.
In the Orthodox Church, there is no such thing as that halfway house called purgatory.
The Church also doesn?t have indulgences, those things that Catholics could exploit
to pay their way out of going to hell.
Why?
Well, again, they say these things were made up and not part of the original scripts.
To them, the difference is important.
In 2007, the Serbian Orthodox Church talked about a few small reforms such as speaking
a traditionally silent prayer.
It sounds like nothing, but people went into the streets protesting.
One person held aloft a sign that read, ?Do not turn us into Roman Catholics!?
You can equally imagine a more modern-thinking Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian meeting
in a bar and one of them saying, ?Remind me again, why am I supposed to not like you??
The other just shrugs and says, ?Because your parents said so.?
No doubt we?ll take a beating for our flagrant simplicity regarding this complex, and for
some people, very serious matter.
However generalizing we?ve been, we?ve at least clumsily tried to cover some bases.
Time to duck for cover.

since the first one I did on Arkham
Knight don't go back and watch it it's
really bad uh but today we're talking
about God of War Ragnarok this is the
pretty hotly anticipated follow-up to
2018's God of War which took one of my
favorite 2000s action franchises into a
new Direction now with this new
adventure Ragnarok in 2022 well I'm
happy to confirm it makes my job mostly
pretty easy today after it feels like so
many games in a row released and felt
kind of middling or disappointing or
forgettable this game is the opposite
and it feels great to just say that
Ragnarok is pretty much everything you
want bigger battles more cool Gods more
Gore bigger worlds bigger end game while
also doubling down on a gentle emotional
impactful story it is equal parts what
you expect you know familiar and
surprising and some thought-provoking
ways but most importantly as fun as hell
man uh Ragnarok is tremendous and some

playing a review copy of the game and
the footage I've captured here is
running on PS5 also I've made sure to be
careful to keep this video extremely

want to spoil I want you to discover it
for yourself just know by the time
you're watching this spoilers are
probably already floating around out
there on the internet so be careful
especially for YouTube thumbnails I've
had those spoil games for me before too
now again no spoilers but the story
setup super basic is a new adventure for
Kratos and atreus time has passed since
the first game and the world is
different and atreus is a bit older and
a bit more mature the focus on the
father-son relationship is different
this time around as atreus kind of leads
the two into a world-hopping adventure
that just gets bigger and bigger and
grapples with prophecy fate being a good
person and uh yeah I mean like I can't
really say anything again I don't want
to ruin it to keep it short and sweet
that's like the back of the box

they set up in the last game it is a big
big world structurally it is all over
the place in a good way like it's not a
typical open world of course but it's
also not just a hub open world with
smaller areas it's just a collection of
big open areas to explore and you keep
stumbling across more as you progress
through the game this game is built on
like a perfect tightrope of stringing
you along not quite linear not quite
open world it's pretty staggering to
continuously stumble upon new large
areas filled with places to explore
across the whole game but also not feel
totally overwhelmed like in your typical
open world or side quest filled game
you'll kind of find yourself dipping
your toe into a little exploration when
you find a new area and then you realize
that you've lost another four hours
completely ignoring the main quest it's
like that and the rewards for
exploration are mixed for me personally
I got really tired of opening up endless
treasure chests and coffins getting the
same few things I did that a hell of a
lot in God of War 2018. by halfway
through this game I was over it how much
hack silver could I really find it's not
that exciting but it doesn't really
matter what I realized is that the
exploration isn't for like the reward
stuff or player progression it's really
the bare minimum the exploration is for
the fun the game is so varied in
encounters and areas and puzzles that
you always want to find a new thing I
found myself exploring less for cool
Loot and way more for just fun and I
think that's says a lot it might vary
for you but that was how I felt
throughout the whole thing I also found
myself diving head first into side
quests to be rewarded with just good
story good characters and cool stuff you
know like no filler nothing really
boring just lots of cool character
moments and action stuff that all adds
to the overall story in meaningful ways
like I love a Meandering and
well-written side quests as much as an
ex-person but when it feels absolutely
essential to everything else going on
and you're having a blast seeing it I
love it and I think they really nailed
that here definitely take the time to
see everything in the game it's
definitely meant to be chewed on and
savored and not like rushed through
whoa is that a dragon what happened here
use caution I think it's dead
yep definitely dead
hey I wonder if

[Music]

I wanted to start with that because
those are my favorite aspects but now
the more video gaming stuff too which is
also no slouch most notably the combat
combat is still really solid you know
they crack the code with 2018 and just
kind of expanded upon it here in this
one I don't know how they did it then
and the same now uh the feel of hits the
dynamic swings and Camera During certain
moves the animations the feedback of
every little bit of movement it took a
lot to sell me on moving away from the
awesome hack and slash stuff from the
old games but it did and now I will say
uh kratos's core moves list remains
pretty much the same but with like a
bunch of layers added on top of it I did
find myself resorting to my old tricks
again you know charge throws hold uh R2
for the big heavy hit that backstep
Dodge and toss uh the timed button
presses to deepen the combos I got right
back into my flow but the game team
slowly dulls out more and more on top of
that with a bunch of stuff I don't
totally want to spoil uh the stuff that
I think is safe to discuss is the more
upfront stuff more Spartan rage options
like you have a few choices on how to
burn your rage meter in more strategic
ways also Shield combat is expanded with
more capabilities and different types of
shields for different occasions or
different play Styles I found myself
just kind of finding my favorite style
and sticking to it but the
experimentation is good and will
probably kick ass for higher level play
also one thing I really liked Kratos
also just feels a bit zippier a bit more
maneuverable he gets up and down Ledges
much quicker now and in combat Arenas it
makes a hell of a difference there's a
reason why it was one of the first
things they showed off when the game was
announced like sprinting off of a ledge
and doing a death from above smash
attack works great but just as equal is
a chain blade grapple hook zipping
yourself across the map to kick someone
else's ass you know and exploration
you're still doing a bunch of slow
boring climbing and squeezing through
cracks in caves and after doing it so
much in these games I'm really not a fan
of it anymore I'm over it but thankfully
Kratos gets some pep in a step when it
comes to murdering because the new
maneuverability in combat is pretty good
just an added layer of control to
something that was already pretty tight
you know the game also has a lot of push
pull in Elemental stuff between your
equipment your abilities and using your
allies abilities like atreus is way more
capable and useful now so uh with all of
this you have a lot more ways to slow
attackers down or stack more damage also
more special runic attacks to discover
and Slot onto your weapons that have a
lot of variety to them you know I really
liked a heavy Rune attack that was like
a big freezing double smash but a simple
classic Ricochet ax throw thing or a
spinning AOE thing work great you can
also unlock special Relic attack
abilities that have even more variation
and like slow down your enemies give
yourself a damage buff stuff like that
and speaking of Buffs the armor and gear
loot stuff is still here and the game
has a big amulet system to progress
through that allows you to stack even
more stuff you would find out in the
wild amulets that give you increased
cooldowns higher melee damage when you
have low Health you know stuff like that
it's all a bit more complex but I was
like I didn't really care too much about
the stats until I really needed them in
the last game here despite there being
more it doesn't really bog you down I
liked it more overall I felt like I
really had to bust my ass to find the
good stuff and then the amount of stuff
I stacked onto my character basically my
character build made it feel a bit more
necessary especially because the game
can kick your ass sometimes now if
you'll remember my various videos from
God of War 2018 my biggest complaint was
the lack of like sub boss enemy types
you know the bigger encounters you
fought that same damn type of troll so
many times in that game and it felt kind
of like it was like one nasty fly in an
otherwise delicious soup of a game does
that does that make sense that sounded
kind of bad but anyway uh they did fix
that now there are a few of the same
main smaller enemies that were in the
last game here which but where they
really improved is the bigger baddies
the bosses the sub bosses all of it is
pretty excellent and very there's big
creature brawls that are over the top
and God of worry there's chunky sword
guy battles just a lot of stuff you're
looking for here I'm happy that there is
a lot to fight now and like the previous
game there are optional enemies to go
out and find that will happily be
waiting to kick your ass but this time
there's a ton of them and they're pretty
interesting there's a lot to stumble
upon and some pretty difficult stuff I
said it before but like this is another
reason why you could spend a lot of time
in this world and uh with that the music
is probably my favorite but visually
it's pretty good as well I played in 60
FPS mode and didn't see any detail drop
or anything and the game ran solid some
might say it's familiar looking at first
glance for sure but art wise it pops off
like character designs and environment
designs are really special the new
Realms especially the more populated
ones are really really cool to see in
motion and have some nice detail now uh
lengthwise the estimates and things
floating around out there were pretty
accurate took me about 30 hours doing
about maybe 70 percent of the main side
quests and I've heard other reviewer
colleagues get way closer to 40 hours
played and as a fan of the series from
the beginning I loved seeing the DNA
continue here you know the music is
absolutely huge and epic sounding and
works great for these incredible battles
where Kratos is choke slamming skeletons
and and all the gods drama and I
really feel like I'm playing like the
successor to the old games without it
kind of nostalgia pandering the whole
time but also on the same coin it tells
an unexpected nuanced story where a lot
of people had feelings and thoughts
about fatherhood and stuff with God of
War 2018 I think this time around folks
will extract and interpret even more
emotions and stuff from this plot and
I'm really looking forward to seeing
what people think now stick with me kind
of like a weird comparison but like Red
Dead Redemption 2 Ragnarok does
something thing I really respect it's a
big massive expensive pretty Triple A
game with all of the detail and the
action and the budget and a million
billion people working on it and a
million billion people probably buying
it but it uses that big
mainstream-ness as an in to tell a
nuanced heartfelt surprising and yet
subtle and unique story and as a single
player story fan for more than any other
type of thing I absolutely love this I
was definitely left pretty satisfied
there is plenty more to that we can talk
about in a spoiler video or something
down the line but for now I'm gonna
leave it at this this is a before you
buy you know how this goes by now I give
you some pros some cons and a bunch of
personal opinion so I want to hear yours
down in the comments I want to know what
you're thinking about the franchise in
general what your favorite is maybe you
only got on board with 2018 I know a lot
of people that did that but what are
your expectations please keep it civil
in the comments and please keep keep it

The iPhone USB-C Law: Explained!,02-11-2022,Marques Brownlee,"all right so it definitely feels like we
get these headlines like every couple
months but this latest round this
version feels pretty firm like apple is
going to make a USBC iPhone a USBC
iPhone is finally confirmed except
is it actually like this I've I've had
to resist the urge to make a video about
this first as long as this has been
talked about for months and months but
now there's actually something concrete
to talk about so let's address it so
it's been brewing for a while but the
background info is at the European Union
has passed legislation requiring all
phones and gadgets sold in the EU to
have a USBC Port it standardizes one
port across everything which includes of
course the iPhone which is currently not
USBC and this passed with flying covers
by the way 602 to 13. so then this past
week Joanna stern of the Wall Street
Journal was talking to some apple people
on stage about it she had apples Craig
federigi and Greg jaws and she asked
them about this ruling and Jaws gives
this you know pretty winding long-winded
answer about how the government
shouldn't be making these types of rules
and creates a lot of E-Waste potentially
but then eventually ends with you know
we don't want to but we'll comply
obviously we'll have to comply we have
no choice as as we do around the world
to comply to a local laws and boom of
course cue the headlines Apple confirms
the iPhone is getting USBC Apple says
iPhones will finally get usb-c ports
Apple confirms iPhones will get USB
type-c charging but
he didn't actually say that like again
let's keep in mind let's remember these
are very well media trained Apple
Executives doing a public interview they
are being very careful with their words
they specifically said they will comply
not that they will make a USBC iPhone
and there is a big difference so you can
actually pull up and read the document
with the exact law that's been passed
that they're all referring to
data.consilium.europa.eu I'll link it
below the like button if you want to
check it out for yourself it's very long
but on page 27 it gets into the exact
details of what it's mandating as far as
charging so to save you the time it
basically says for these categories here
including smartphones if a device is
capable of being charged via wired
charging it shall have a USBC port and
be able to be charged by a USBC cable
and the press release from the European
Parliament says that this will be in
effect by the end of the calendar year
2024 and
I'm with dave2d on this one apple never
specifically said that they will make a
USBC iPhone they would never say that
but I also don't think they ever will
see first of all when they switch to
lightning on that iPhone 5 back in the
day it was genuinely an innovation like
it was a much smaller Port which let
them push plenty of power and data for
the time and that opened up way more
room inside the phone than the outgoing
ancient 30 pin could allow so yes people
were mad for a few months about having
to get a new charging cable sure but
pretty quickly everyone sort of just
adopted and accepted lightning for the
iPhone and then Apple made What's called
the made for iPhone program or mfi which
basically means they get a cut of every
certified lightning accessory that
anyone ever sells so you want to make a
lightning accessory that plugs into the
iPhone and have it be taken seriously at
all well you'll need to get it certified
and then it's certified mfi made for
iPhone and that'll be 10 off the top of
every unit straight to Apple thank you
very much like just this mfi program has
made Apple millions and millions of
dollars over the years thanks to the
lightning Port but now it's 2022. it's
been almost a decade and lightning is
kind of an old outdated port at this
point we've moved on we've gotten much
better charging speeds and data speeds
and so lightning kind of sucks now so
Apple has been working towards their
next jump but their next jump wasn't
planned to be USB type-c their next jump
was planned to be to no port at all yeah
that's correct they've been moving
towards removing the port from the
iPhone entirely I have a whole video
about this I highly recommend watching
it after this one I'll make it the first
link below but yes Apple would rather
just get rid of the port entirely than
switch to USB type c I always wonder how
they'll address it on stage like I
imagine it'll have the little moment
where they're like how much do you
really use the charging port on your
phone and it's taking up precious space
inside the phone and hey we've had the
courage to invent this incredible new
charging technology magsafe now magsafe
magsafe is fine you know in 2022 it's
okay it doesn't fix the slow data speed
problem but it does slap onto the back
of the phone with magnets and charged at
15 watts and I think Apple's wanted
magsafe to sort of grow and evolve a
little bit faster than it has and it
kind of hasn't but now with this new
hard-coded deadline imposed by the EU
they will have the next iPhone the 2023
iPhone 15 and the next iPhone after that
the 2024 iPhone 16 to really push
magsafe before the next iPhone after the
deadline the iPhone 17.
can go portless so now it becomes very
easy to see a world where Apple stops
giving you a lightning cable with the
newest iPhones but just starts giving
everyone just the magsafe wireless
charging puck in the box and that's it
just to get people used to wireless
charging for two whole years before the
transition is just like yeah this is how
we charge all our phones now insofar as
they are capable of being recharged via
wired charging
USB type-c Oh They'll comply they'll
comply all right that was a smart reply
but yeah if it doesn't charge via wired
charging at all then they don't need a
usb-c port but the iPhone isn't the only
lightning thing that Apple makes by the
way there's some other accessories that
they make that are also on this list
Apple's magic keyboard the Magic Mouse
and airpods all also charge with
lightning right now so they will have
now also until 2024 to get that
transition going to either switch to
USBC or be portless and they've also
already kind of started that transition
you might have noticed that the new
Apple TV Siri remote charges via USBC
this year instead of lightning like it
was previously and of course the new
airpods cases all charged via lightning
but also have added magsafe compatible
wireless charging and it would feel
pretty easy for them to get rid of that
lightning port in the next two years so
the real question is will magsafe be
Advanced Enough by then for people to
not go insane will it actually because
the point is it should actually be
better than lightning for them to move
on and move forward from lightning it
should be a technological advancement
and that's actually the point and that
that gets us back to that original Spiel
that Jaws made that I skipped through
earlier because as much as it is very
much apple PR self-serving corporate
talk I actually agree with
almost
everything that he says there because
what he's saying is basically that we're
fine with the government making
regulation with a positive end goal in
mind right but they shouldn't be so
prescriptive with exactly how to do that
technologically speaking that part
should be up to the engineers and the
innovators at these companies to figure
out so if the government has a good idea
in Tech which can happen sometimes like
for example wanting hearing impaired
people to be able to use smartphones
then great fine then let the companies
actually figure out a way to make their
phones compatible with hearing aids and
then work on that Tech and make it
better over time that way everybody wins
and the tech actually improves so
because they're mandating USB type c for
all wired charging devices now it can
feel kind of like a win because
lightning kind of sucks and this is
better
but we're already kind of pushing the
envelope of USB type c that's not
exactly new either and we're getting
like 200 watt charging in smartphones
now and super high fast data speeds
eventually in a couple years we're going
to move on to something even better than
USB type c
and then what so I don't really want to
hear about the environment and E-Waste
from Apple of all people like I get that
a lot of people have lightning cables
and that's what you love about lightning
but that never stopped you from changing
all the other stuff to USB type-c so
really the behind the scenes problem is
the government being so prescriptive as
to require USB type-c instead of just
giving an overall goal like unified
charging standards to reduce e-waste and
you know maybe the the law can update
over time to keep up with the tech but
how much do you trust that to happen so
in conclusion hey I'll take a USBC
iPhone if that ends up being what
happens out of this but it's probably
not going to be what happens
um and again we'll see but it's like it
can feel like a win because USBC is
better than lightning right now
but that's just in the short term and I
think in the long term it's pretty clear
Apple's got a lot of time to think about
how they're going to get theirs
but hey when wires Wayne Wireless will
win

The Genius Marketing Strategy of Marlboro Cigarettes | Business Marketing Case study,30-03-2021,Think School,"People, on the historic date of 11th of January 1964,
it was officially declared by the United States government
that cigarette causes cancer.
And within a day an $8 Billion dollar tobacco industry and the incomes of 7,50,000 families was at stake.

While most companies saw their sales dropping down
there was one company that miraculously went from having just 1% market share

to becoming the 4th largest cigarette brand in the world
in less than one year.
And after 1970 when cigarette advertisements were permanently banned from televisions
this brand became even more popular
to go on to become the largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the world.
This brand that I'm talking about goes by the name Marlboro.
And Marlboro today is so huge that
it has got more consumers than it's next 10 competitors combined.
The question is - What the hell did they do ?
because of which the very same cancer report and the ban which is essentially supposed to kill it's business

ended up becoming a stepping stone for Marlboro to become a $58 Billion brand.

The answer to this question lies in one of the most iconic marketing strategies
ever witnessed by mankind.
which is called lifestyle marketing.
Now let's try to understand this using a very simple example that is closer to home.
If you are a 90s kid and you watched Sachin Tendulkar play
I bet you that at some point in your life or someone in you're friend circle
must have bought an MRF bat.
And chances are that when you visited the store
you knew nothing about English Willow, Kashmir Willow.
You did not care which wood the bat was made of.
You did not care whether it was original or duplicate, you just wanted a bat.
And then you had two choices
bats with no stickers or bats with MRF stickers.
And you chose the MRF bat by default
And then after that god knows after how many years later you realised
that the fullform of MRF is Madras Rubber Factory.
And the fact that MRF is primarily a rubber tyre manufacturing company
which just happened to sponsor Sachin Tendulkar.
Later on this very same thing happened to Reebok when Dhoni started using Reebok bats.
Now here the question is - is it a coincidence that millions of children all across the country

were so stupid to mindlessly buy a bat with a sticker of a rubber tyre company ?

If not, then how the hell did this even happen ?
Well, here's where the magic of lifestyle marketing happens.
We all idolised Sachin Tendulkar and we all wanted to be like Sachin Tendulkar.

So subconsciously, the MRF bats made us feel as if
we were holding the exact same bat as Sachin Tendulkar himself.
So to put that straight, what we essentially bought into
when we bought MRF bats is not the bat itself
but the connect that it had with our idol, that is, Sachin Tendulkar
because we wanted to be like Sachin Tendulkar.
Now in the US the same thing happened to Nike's Air Jordan shoes lineup
wherein when Nike signed up Michael Jordan
the fascination for Air Jordan shoes became so crazy
that even today, after 18 years of Michael Jordan's retirement
he still makes $100 million dollars every single year just in royalty.
This is what we call as lifestyle marketing wherein
consumers buy more into the lifestyle of the icon whose associated with the product

than the product itself.
And this is exactly what the marketeers of Marlboro cigarettes did to their brand.

After the 1964 report, which was released by the surgeon general of the US,
brands started to do everything in their capacity to keep their reputation.
Some brands tried to justify cigarettes while some brands completely disapproved the very research itself.

Back then Marlboro was a very small company that made cigarettes only for women.
But as soon as this news broke out
the parent company of Marlboro, which is Philip Morris
decided to shift their method of marketing
and became an epitome of business propaganda in the 20th century
So what the marketeers of Marlboro did is that
instead of justifying smoking and using statistics that were difficult to understand
they came out with a campaign called the Marlboro Man.
wherein they introduced a character who was supposedly everything a man wanted to be like.

and they named this character ""The Marlboro Man"".
Marlboro Man was a cowboy who had perfectly built up body
and the commercial showcased him as the ultimate architype of manhood.
He was tough, affectionate and stylish and overall stood as the icon of freedom and manliness.

And just as we kids bought into MRF bats
men of the 1960s were so fascinated by the Marlboro man
and started buying Marlboro cigarettes
that the commercial became a massive game changer for the company.
And within a year Marlboro went from having less than 1% market share
to becoming the 4th largest cigarette manufacturer in the world.
And the fun fact is in all of those commercials
cigarette was not even the primary subject of focus.
In fact, cigarette as a product got less than 10 seconds of time footage time
in all of those commercials.
And because of this even when cigarette commercials were permanently banned from television
and brands couldn't show cigarettes in commercials or TV,
Marlboro was very easily able to navigate through that situation
because their focus was anyways not on cigarettes but on Marlboro Man himself.

And that is how they were able to communicate their emotion very easily
even through print and magazine.
And this is the reason why even after the 1970 ban
Marlboro's business still kept growing.
In fact, the sales skyrocketed because the rest of the brands were struggling
to market their brands without showing their products.
And that is how Marlboro became a legend in advertising
and laid the foundation for Marlboro to become a $58 billion brand.
Now, more than a business lesson there is a very very important life lesson
that we all need to learn from this iconic case study.
People, just like Marlboro in the 1960s, even today
what we often fail to realize is that
we are constantly being bombarded with lifestyle cigarette commercials
that do not appear as ads but in the form of pop culture icons.
Now, this includes a James Bond appearance
wherein he appears in a tucks and symbolises gentlemanliness
or Kabir Singh who is portrayed as the epitome of manliness.
Now, regardless of how lucrative they look
what is important for us to understand is that
they are merely tapping onto your insecurities to convince you to do something
which will give you a feeling as if you are an elevated version of yourself.
But the truth is
because of your lack of self awareness
you don't realise that your insecurities are putting money into their pockets

eventually to make those companies billions of dollars
but to turn you into a sick, miserable addict
of either cigarettes or social validation, depending on what you're buying into.
So keep your eyes open and do not fall into these traps.
And last and most importantly
my big brother's advice to you is
""Always remember that buying dumb sh*t will never make you feel happier
or make you a better version of yourself.
The only thing that will make you feel better is your acceptance of your insecurities and imperfections.

And at the end of the day if you do not embrace your insecurities
some billion dollar brand will dig into your misery and
and make a fortune out of it.""
So think about it and if you think I make sense to you then help me spread this message
by sharing this video with as many people as possible.
And like once a great woman said,""Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius

and it is better to be absolutely ridiculous than to be absolutely boring."" - Marilyn Monroe.

Great Horned Owl on the Hunt | Nat Geo Wild,27-05-2019,Nat Geo WILD,"This is the great horned owl's time.

He's one of the largest and most powerful owl
species in America.

As dusk turns to dark, he looks down into a forest clearing.

His eyes are tuned for optimal night vision.
But more importantly, he listens.

His ear-like horns are simply tufts of feathers.
No one knows for sure what they're for,
but they have nothing to do with hearing.

His real ears are hidden under his head feathers.
They're positioned asymmetrically.
The right one is slightly higher than the left one.
Sound reaches one ear a fraction of a second
later than the other.
That gives him incredible accuracy
pinpointing the source.
A faint rustling in the dead leaves.
It's another nighttime hunter, a deer mouse.
He's patrolling the leaf litter, looking for bugs and seed.

The owl hasn't quite keyed in on the sounds,
but a turn of the head changes that.

Its head spins a full 270 degrees,
3/4 of a full rotation.
His ears tell his light sensitive eyes
exactly where to look.
His two main senses are in sync.

Target locked.

Now, the owl unleashes another secret weapon--
fringed wing feathers that muffle any flapping sound.
It's a double advantage.
The owl can still hear its prey while flying,
and the mouse doesn't have a clue what's coming

and probably never knew what hit him.

Keeping itself fed rules a bird's daily life.",Informative
Tesla Glass | The Secret to a Quiet Cabin,16-09-2021,Tesla,"so we're here in los angeles at our
glass technology center where we make
all the prototypes for all of our
vehicles and to give you a real life
example of the acoustic performance of
our side drop just roll up the window
here
to give you an idea of how comfortable
the experience is in our vehicle
so as the designers first sketch the
model y or s and x and three they sketch
the glass from the front of the vehicle
all the way to the rear of the vehicle
and we spend a ton of time making sure
that each glass position is the right
curvature is the right size and shape in
order to give that seamless approach one
of the coolest things that we've done is
incorporate acoustic side laminated
drops across every vehicle at tesla so
what this consists of is a glass
sandwich you have a glass outer and a
glass inner and in between an acoustic
dampening layer for road noise wind
noise that the customer will experience
and make the inside occupant feel
quieter so what we have here is a two
percent tint we use on roofs and things
of that nature we combine that with
different types of thin films that have
properties like solar for reflecting
radiation and we'll combine that with a
standard pvb that has uh different
properties some have acoustic properties
others have solar properties so we have
to be very careful on what we choose
to go into the vehicle
as we look at these large pieces of
glass safety is a huge consideration so
we work with our exteriors our closures
team on making sure it is very safe for
our occupants for things like rollover
roof crush testing then we go into the
thermal aspects to make sure it gets the
best thermal performance the roof itself
absorbs 99 of the uv radiation coming in
so it's amazingly safe even though you
have this large open experience inside
your vehicle so across all of our
vehicles at tesla we have a suite of
autopilot cameras here in the front of
the car looking forward through the
windshield so in a sense our windshield
is becoming a lens in front of the
camera and we focus on things with
distortion as well as working hand in
hand with our autopilot team on
functionality heating function as well
as diffraction of the images that are
coming in and i would say it's part of
the way that we're leading the industry
and setting the standard for autopilot
functionality and the glass quality
that's required for autopilot",Informative
Rishi Sunak Selected as U.K. Prime Minister & U.S. Test Scores Drop | The Daily Show,25-10-2022,The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,"according to the National assessment of
educational progress
U.S students have suffered a record drop
in their math scores
now many experts say that the two years
of covert disruptions are to blame for
this
but in my opinion everyone would do
better if the smart kids would just stop
hiding their answers yeah loosen up
Angela we get it you study let's open it
up
and I know I know I know this is
distressing news for all the parents out
there but but just remember this is the
best time to cheat your kids out of
their allowance they won't know the
difference yeah five plus two yeah
that's that's what you get that's ten
meanwhile in San Francisco officials are
coming on the fire after it came out
that a new public toilet that is being
you know built in a popular tourist spot
will cost the city
1.7 million dollars
a single public toilets
yeah now before you complain remember
this toilet is going to be top of the
line the seat will come pre-peed on and
uh
the graffiti on the walls will be
written by George R.R Martin wow
in sports news the Houston Astros swept
the Yankees to win a spot in the World
Series and attending the game oh you're
going to save those booze because
attending the game in New York was Texas
Senator Ted Cruz
yeah who was greeted by Yankee fans just
like that
yeah there were a lot of booze a lot of
extended middle fingers which at this
point people why does anyone bother Ted
Cruz sees those soft and he may not even
be offended right he might just think
that's how people wave now just like hi
hello how are you hello hi Ted Cruz
all right let's move on to some of the
biggest stories of the day you know with
food prices going up gas prices going up
and War crippling Europe it may be easy
to get distracted by short-term problems
and lose sights of the long-term
problems that'll actually kill us all
which is why climate activists are going
to Extreme Measures to get our attention
another Act of food infused art
vandalism this time with mashed potatoes
that's right climate change activists
tossed potatoes onto a Claude Monet
painting at a German museum look at this
officials there say the painting it
wasn't damaged and that it's covered by
glass last week activists threw tomato
soup onto Vincent van Gogh sunflowers at
the National Gallery in London there was
some minor damage to the frame but the
painting was unharmed and in both cases
activists then glued their hands to the
wall yeah increasingly around the world
climate change activists are vandalizing
famous Arts to bring attention to
climate change first they splashed food
on a van go now a Monet they also hit
the Jackson Pollock but no one noticed
and as much as I agree with the message
I
museum is the right place to do this
oh because think about if you protest in
the streets everyone knows it's a
protest but if anything happens in a
museum half the people are just going to
think it's part of the Arts you know
yeah you could be in front of a painting
like I'm having a heart attack to be
like oh very powerful very powerful no
help me ah yes the Cry for Help we all
feel in the modern world bravo bravo
also I feel like at this point the
problem with climate change isn't a lack
of awareness right it's more the fact
that a ton of people just don't give a
and I stand to be corrected but I just
don't think that those people who don't
care about climate change care about
fancy Arts you know I doubt your mega
uncle is going to be like no not Monet's
water lilies no all right you win you
can tax carbon I agree with you
you know if anything these protests
might bring more publicity to the art
than to climate change
yeah like you tell me when was the last
time you thought about Monet and sex
dreams don't count
like if I was a painting in a museum
right now I would be begging I'll be
begging to get some food thrown on me

oh look look someone's walking up to us
right now with a giant bowl of pudding
this could be our break break oh the
pudding is oh no way they're just eating
it oh what the hell man weird snack to
bring to a museum
oh come on people I want to go viral
somebody throw some food at me you know
who I hate the polar bears I hate them
bunch of coke drinking losers they
deserve to die
nothing
all right forget it I guess back to
staring at people's butts all day
oh that's a nice spot look at that one
look at that one oh
let's make like America's money and move
on to China over the last decade Xi
Jinping has gradually Taken full control
of the Chinese Communist Party he's put
his people in all of the top positions
he's pushed out all of his top Rivals
and he is the sole owner of the password
for the country's Netflix accounts
so no one in China can watch Dharma
without him he's like no don't watch
without me that's one of our shows
together they're like these are all our
shows together we're Communists anyway
over the weekend
president XI was formally re-upped as
communist leader of the party right
that's what he was for an unprecedented
third term which means he will rule over
the nation of 1.4 billion people for at
least another five years and if anyone
doubts of how powerful Xi Jinping has
become just look at how he treated
China's previous leader China's leader
Xi Jinping is beginning an historic
third term in office after being
anointed again as the head of the
country's Communist party but there was
an unexpected twist in the normally
highly choreographed Chinese National
Congress over the weekend when his
predecessor was escorted off the stage
two AIDS appeared to remove XI jinping's
predecessor hujin Tau from the front row
who who appears confused even to resist
while Xi Jinping shows zero sympathy was
the 79 year old who unwell or was it
some kind of political power play we'll
probably never know as the incident has
already been scrubbed from Chinese TV
and social media
God damn
grubbed from social media and TV and did
you see that they picked that old man
out and just escorted him this is
escorted him out like he was Kanye bar
mitzvah
and do you see Xi Jinping
what's even once even while he's just
sitting there like he can't do anything
like the old man Taps him like Hey
you're going to do it he's the most
powerful person in China and he's like
sorry there must be some rule or
something I'm new here I don't know I
can't help you I I can't do anything
I don't even know what this means was it
supposed to send a message was it not
because if it did I don't think it
worked because nobody knows what
happened right they either took this guy
away as some kind of power grab or
because he just had one too many Island
Iced Teas we don't know right who knows
I mean I guess I guess we do know that
it didn't go according to plan because
they scrubbed all the video of it from
the internet they wouldn't do that if
they wanted people to see it you know
it's like your browser history
yeah nobody's clearing it because they
donate it to charity
you know no one's like I can't let my
wife see what a good person I am I can
so yeah this is a weird opaque story
that has left everyone guessing
and I guess the only question I have is
can we hire those guys for whenever Joe
Biden starts rambling in a speech can we
you know just to bring them in he's like
I passed a student bill that with 50 and
100
000 and 56 000 800 okay sir come on with
us come on let's take him to where we
hide Kamala come on let's go
all right finally let's move on from
China to a country with a leadership
situation is a little less secure Great
Britain last week Liz truss announced
after just 44 days in office she would
be stepping down as prime minister so
she could move on to becoming that
person who everyone recognizes but they
can't quite remember from where
like did we go to a high school oh
you're the Prime Minister oh so sorry
about that anyway can I have two large
popcorns please and uh
[Applause]
anyway let's trust is gone and it looks
like the UK has got a brand new man we
begin in the United Kingdom which is
about to get its third prime minister in
less than two months just a short time
ago the ruling conservative party
announced that former Finance Minister
Rishi sunak won the race to become
partly leader and prime minister the
Richie sunac will become this country's
first ever prime minister of color first
ever Asian prime minister and first ever
Hindu prime minister Rishi sunak not
only the first person of color to walk
through 10 dining also the youngest
prime minister here at about two
centuries really a historic day a former
investment banker he and his wife are
reported to be among the country's
richest people it is the greatest
privilege of my life to be able to serve
the party I love and give back to the
country I owe so much to yeah that's
right the UK's new prime minister is
former Finance Minister Rishi sunak and
he's Indian he's Hindu and he's only 42
years old which means he will probably
serve well into his 42 and a half's
easily
and and let's not forget
let's not forget another important first
he's also the first Prime Minister who's
an absolute snack yeah oh look at you
Rishi
see don't forget who came before don't
forget
you're moving on up
now
of course of course not everyone in the
UK is happy about Rishi sunak taking the
top spot and making history and it's not
because of his policies or because of
his personality no there are some people
who have a problem with um something
else as as this caller to a British
radio show so eloquently explained is
the real problem here Jerry that Rishi
sunak is a brown man and you don't trust
him at the top of this country
well could you imagine him going to the
Scottish nationalists and being the
prime minister of the Scottish
nationalists could you imagine me
becoming the prime minister of Pakistan
or Saudi Arabia no these things matter
I'm sorry you don't like it but this is
a predominantly we're talking about
England right
85 of the English people yes are white
English people and they want to see a
prime minister that reflects them yeah
yeah this guy has a good point can you
imagine if White English people wanted
to rule countries where no one looked
like them oh that would never happen can
you imagine that world what would that
world be like
man you know what's so funny to me it's
funny how racists always say oh
colonization was fine it was business
until they feel like they're being
colonized then all of a sudden it's like
something needs to be done something
needs to be done
not even be colonized the guy is British
what's wrong with you
you know if you ask me British racists
are looking at this whole thing all
wrong this could be a good thing for you
people after 400 years you'll finally
get to legitimately blame a brown person
for your country's problems you're
living your dreams wake up
I mean there is a part of me
there's a part of me that feels a little
bad for England's racists
no because because remember remember
they voted for brexit specifically
to keep Britain White
and that vote starts with a seven-year
chain of dominoes
that has now led directly to an Indian
prime minister

oh man
yeah they're probably like oh this is
certainly a rich irony at my expense in
it yeah
and here's the thing keep in mind this
caller even says that he is Tori so this
is the same party as Rishi sunec right
which means they probably agree on all
the same policies he just doesn't like
that he's not white which I don't
understand I truly don't understand what
are you scared of oh what is this what
is this caller scared of does he think
sunak is going to walk up to the podium
on his first day in office and be like
it is the greatest privilege of my life
to be able to give back to the country I
owe so much to and to show my gratitude
I just want to say I'm selling the
entire country to India
[Applause]
it's not gonna happen you racist
all right that's it for the headlines
before we go to a break I started
checking on all the latest social media
trends with our very own running Chang
everybody

hey Trevor all right
let's see what's blowing up social media
today uh we got Taylor Swift
anti-Semitism Tom Brady you know the
usual but what's lighting social media
in England up right now is the new prime
minister of the week Rishi sunak and I
know everyone is really excited that
this is the first Asian prime minister
but let's be clear Indians are not Asian
okay okay are still people great people
they're just not Asian people okay no no
answer me this if this guy is Asian how
come when he became prime minister I
felt absolutely nothing
when I was down at dim sum Palace this
morning me and the Fellas weren't like
oh that's me up there
Phil see I love how Indians try to have
it both ways like being Indian and Asian
pick a lane okay
yeah I bet if I show up in a Bollywood
film I'm just gonna blend right in right
because all just one people just having
a good time
also speaking of Asians and Indians real
quick you mentioned America's math
scores were dropping since coven or
something right I mean math scores in
America were bad before Colvin how could
you how could it get any worse like the
question used to be what time did the
train leave the station now you gotta
explain what a train is
but but but the biggest trending story
has got to be the climate change art
protester videos okay and my question is
who the hell is doing Museum security
these days
you see people walking in with two
buckets of mashed potatoes and a high
visibility vest
and you don't think anything's going on
we caught by surprise that noise like
it's sneaking around
I mean the people show up in high
visibility visibility construction vest
just keep an eye on them okay just
imagine this Venn diagram it's real
simple on in one Circle you've got
people wearing construction vests in the
other Circle you've got people with no
upper body strength okay now when they
overlap in the middle then those are
climate activists
okay
make sure you check every cavity for
sloppy joes also the worst part is this
painting wasn't even expecting it at
least throw it at a painting that's
ready I mean see this guy knows some bad
shit's about to go down
all right what are they even doing what
throwing guacamole at Art isn't gonna
change anything all right the only
people who care about other pretentious
douchebags like check out this tweet I
found online for some random all
right look look at this oh my God
I'm at the Louvre I saw Mona Lisa for
the first time is she smiling or not
it's so powerful everyone should see
oh
really
you think everyone should see the most
famous painting ever what a great
discovery I mean I wonder what else this

Introduction to Cooking,31-05-2022,Gordon Ramsay,"packed with cooking tips information and
100 recipes to stake your life on right
tonight is all about keeping it simple
keeping it simple in the kitchen doesn't
mean you can't have amazing food that
not only looks incredible but tastes
fantastic too
my first recipe is so easy it removes
the stress from cooking and is a
pleasure to make chili beef lettuce
wraps
cooking should never be a chore the more
you cook the more confident you become
that way you actually start to enjoy it
and that's the key to good cooking have
a bit of fun along the way
this is minced beef and minced pork the
pork needs to sit in there otherwise the
going to dry out
really important to season the mints
before you cook it
pan nice and hot
a touch of olive oil
mince in
breaking up like that really helps to
sort of separate it so we can fry it off
with a lot of color
with your spoon
just go through
[Music]
and start breaking that up
the most important thing to remember is
mint is made up of cheap cuts brisket
belly
short rib so
it needs help
and frying off the mince for color is so
important
if this pan wasn't hot your mince is
going to boil there's a horrible gray
color on there
and there's no flavor on your mince
taste a little bit
[Music]
tastes delicious it's seasoned
beautifully see how crispy it's going
take it
much further than you've ever taken
mince before nice and crispy
smells incredible
and draining it is crucial it keeps the
mince nice and crispy and you get rid of
that
excess fat
that's lovely
now just wipe out the pan then wash it
low gas
now we're going to add texture to the
mince
finely chopped chili
ginger
garlic and spring onions
spring onions give this sort of mince a
really nice freshness
because it just gives that crunch
nice and thinly
now i'm gonna fry off the chilis the
ginger the garlic first
sesame seed oil teaspoon only in
garlic chili ginger in
fry that off nicely
the sesame seed oil just lifts up the
whole flavour
brown sugar that starts to really
caramelize the chili the garlic and the
ginger
mince in
now
my fish sauce that gives it the
saltiness
you can see now why it's so important to
get that minced really crispy because
nothing's going soggy staying really
crispy
fresh lime
that makes the mince fragrant
and then
lime juice roll it
and squeeze that in there
[Music]
incredible i've got the salty
i've got the heat
i've got the sweetness now i've got the
acidicness as well and then finally my
spring onions in right at the last
minute so i've got crunch in there as
well smells
amazing
literally cook the mince now with sort
of 30 seconds
to go
gas off and take it out

looks incredible smells so inviting
[Music]
to go with the chili beef i'm making a
simple sweet and spicy dipping sauce so
everyone can dress the crispy mince to
their own taste
dipping sauce a teaspoon
the brown sugar soy sauce
gives it a nice sort of dark rich color
sesame seed oil
a tablespoon and just top that up with a
tablespoon
of olive oil that stops the sesame seed
all becoming too rich
a teaspoon
of fish sauce and then a touch of chili
leave the seeds in again i want the heat
in that sauce
so impressive an amazing show off center
piece
lime juice in
in the coriander chop it through once
give that little mix up
just check the seasoning
that's lovely nice and rich
now the lettuce i'm going to use baby
gem because it's really nice and durable
and sort of quite strong
so you just sort of sit
these nice
trimmed lettuce leaves
around
now the exciting part serve take your
lettuce up
spoon in
your mince
and then
a little touch of dressing
just a little drizzle
nice and that's the secret of having
good easy relaxed food is that
you just help yourself
food that looks and tastes a million
bucks doesn't have to be complex
this dish is as fun to cook as it is to
eat
[Music]

one of the keys to keeping it simple is
to prepare all the ingredients in
advance the more organized you are in
the kitchen the easier cooking becomes

recipes that with a bit of advanced
preparation are so simple to make

my next recipe it pays to get prepped
for is garlic and saffron mayonnaise
[Music]
first get your ingredients to hand
eggs should be out of the fridge and at
room temperature

and a wonderful colour
next separate three eggs put the yolks
into a mixing bowl
add dijon mustard
finely chopped garlic

chopping knife
followed by a small paring knife which
is brilliant for prepping vegetables
and then this baby here a serrated edge
knife for carving and slicing
basically that is it
before you buy a knife hold it in your
hand and make sure it feels right for
you
the secret behind a great set of knives
is in the handle if you're comfortable
holding the handle
your cutting can be so much easier the
firmer the grip the better the chopping
the heavier the handle the more control
you've got over the blade
with these three knives you can't go
wrong
welcome back to my ultimate cookery
course
[Music]
this is my guide to keeping it simple
my next recipe is easy and a pleasure to
make if you're organized with everything
ready in advance
[Music]
miso poached salmon with asian
vegetables
organization is key in the kitchen take
a couple of minutes before you start and
set yourself up make sure you know where
everything is stock spatula pan etc it
becomes less stressful but more
importantly the end results are
incredible
[Music]
first off get your pan on
whisk
and stock
start off with this amazing fermented
soy bean puree
into the pan three nice tablespoons
gas on now get your fish stock and whisk
into the puree
be generous with the stock
you want this nice
light
broth basically
you can buy miso paste from big
supermarkets and it works brilliantly
with salmon
poaching the salmon in the miso stuff
gives it a really nice sort of sweet
earthy
creamy flavor it's incredible bring up
to the bowl
i'm going to infuse the broth and make
it a little bit more fragrant
kaffir lime leaf is very lemony inside
the miso broth
then chopped chili
chili's in
and finely sliced ginger
that's simmering beautifully
now we're gonna poach the salmon
poaching means cooking it in liquid but
it's cooked gently and the secret here
is to keep that salmon skin on if we
took the skin off now the salmon can
actually break up
whilst it's poaching skin side
down i'm just going to slide that in
under
nice
the minute that stock
starts boiling turn it down let it
simmer
take a little ladle and just every
couple of minutes pour over
that makes sure the top of the salmon is
cooked evenly and keeps it nice and
moist
and poaching is one of the most delicate
ways of cooking so you have to handle it
with care
whilst the salmon's poaching in the miso
broth start preparing your vegetables
i'm using tender stem broccoli and bak
choy
i always like to cook the leaf and the
stem separately the leaf is like sort of
spinach and the stem is so much thicker
it's almost as thick as a stick of
celery
so i like to get the stems sliced
just so i've got that nice sort of
christmas
place the leaves together nicely roll
them up
nice and tight and then
slice them down
now my salmon already
the flavor in that broth has been
elevated
now it tastes really fishy got the heat
the chili spiciness the ginger and the
caffeine lime leaf
take your fish slice and place it very
gently underneath the salmon and push it
down fish slices are flexible for that
reason bend it
lift it up
just touch looking for a springy firm
texture and just
sit there on top
and it will touch the broth over it
it stops it from drying out
leave that to cool down for two minutes
bring the stock
back up to the boil broccoli and
bak choy stems
in
a little taste
it's getting better and better and
better
cook the broccoli and the bok choy stems
for one minute and then add the tops in
turn the salmon into your hand
and just peel all that skin off the skin
also helps to keep the salad nice and
moist
then gently flake the salmon that's the
secret behind
poaching everything just stays
so moist
wonderful long shards of pink now
just before we serve
we're going to add our mushrooms these
are enoki mushrooms you can buy these
enoki mushrooms in big supermarkets and
good grocers
slice them off i'm going to put half in
and the other half i'm gonna serve with
the salmon
toasted sesame seed oil put a little
drip in there just rub
and you're just lining almost like a
little coat of varnish start off with
your mushrooms and then my salmon
four nice layers
and then finally
the mushrooms
top with the vegetables and then finally
a nice ladle
that beautiful
really sumptuous
rich stock
lovely
and that is an amazing misu poached
salmon soup
simplify your cooking by getting
organized and amazing food will be
coming out your kitchen every day
and for great food you need great
ingredients
[Music]
next up my shopping guide to getting the
finest fish
when i buy my fish i only want the
freshest and the best
and if anyone knows how to get the best
it's roger kent barbara he's been buying
and selling fish at the world famous
billings gate market in london for over
50 years
i love fish
i think it's the greatest food of all
time i sell literally every variety
there is i could feed you a different
fish
365 days a year this guy really knows
how to sniff out the good from the bad
all fish smell different the longer it's
around
the more fishy it will smell
when it's lovely and fresh
it doesn't smell
whenever you're gonna buy fish don't be
frightened get your nose right into it
don't go like that get it into it smell
it
smells delightful it smells what i call
salmony and it's lovely barramundi it's
a lovely fish the way to tell good fish
is look at it closely it's shining it's
still got the bloom on it his eyes are
as bright as yours look in the gill
lovely and red put it in a bag for the
gentleman please people should always be
asking about their fish
what kind of fish is it where does it
come from a nice salmon 19 pound it's a
bargain at 20 pounds roger's right
salmon's brilliant value and a great
all-rounder really healthy and super
delicious here's a quick look at the
different cuts and how to use them
[Music]
whole salmon always impresses it's
fantastic stuffed and steamed either in
a fish kettle or in the oven wrapped in
foil
steaks are great value and brilliant
baked
a cider salmon is perfect for poaching
home curing or baking in pastry
the fillet is so versatile easy fast to
cook and great for pan frying
smoked salmon delicious cooked or raw i
love it with scrambled eggs
[Music]
broadly there's white fish
and there's oily fish they come under
two different sections here we have
white fish
it's lovely it's cold it's the best cot
in the world it comes to a place called
peterhead it's nice and white the whiter
the better one of the most oily fish
you'll find mackerel there it is
lovely color
with most fish the fresher they are the
harder they are if you're not well and
you're ill
have a mackerel sprats otherwise known
as top hats here we have flat fish and
these are known as place as you can see
they've got spots the redder they are
the fresher they are it really is a
lovely fish to eat king jules couldn't
have better for fish fresh enough for
royalty follow your fishmonger's advice
and you'll never ever have another dodgy
dover sole again
[Music]
next my tricks of the trade and kitchen
tips
first how to chop an onion this is the
root that's absolutely crucial leave
that on there if you cut that off the
onion will start to bleed and you'll
start crying rapidly
slice going forward let the weight of
the knife do the work
three fingers
one in front two behind and this part of
the knuckle is going to guide the knife
fingers on top of the onion point the
knife towards the root and try to get
as close to the root as possible nice
long
stroke
and then push the onion back together
push the knife halfway in to the onion
slightly tilt the knife down
one at the top
and then gripping the onion like a
tennis ball holding it together in place

with the weight of the blade to cut
through that onion to get to the base of
the root
again turn it round up and down motion
and that's what we're left there no
waste just the root
and look
there
you've got a really nice finely chopped
onion
so much great cooking depends on
starting with a high enough heat if a
recipe calls for a hot pan put it on
early so it gets smoking hot and always
remember to preheat your oven at least
20 minutes before cooking
clean cook is an efficient cook my tip
for a tidy cooking area is to always
have a waste bowl next to you it saves
you going back and forth to the bin

never add salt to eggs before cooking
them because it ruins the texture and
dulls the colour instead save your
seasoning to the very end
[Music]
the key to cooking meat is to make sure
it's at room temperature before you
begin cook straight from the fridge the
mussel fibers will be tight which
results in tough meat and always let it
rest afterwards so relax is becoming
tender and juicy

the frying pan is one of your best
friends it's so versatile in the kitchen
learning to use it with these is a must
and i'm going to show you how
first up my delicious pan fried pork
chops with sweet and sour peppers
whether it's in the restaurant or even
at home one of my golden rules for
producing fantastic food is learning to
cook with confidence this recipe is so
straightforward but tastes absolutely
amazing
pan on
get that nice and hot
you think of the sort of density of a
pork chop how it needs a little bit of
help
sweet sound peppers
go brilliantly well
first slice the peppers that's the flat
side of the pepper so stand it up trying
to slice a pepper
on the side is a nightmare there's the
center start off
it's almost like sort of peeling an
orange go all the way around
and down
and look that's what you want
now place the pepper down
three finger rule one finger in front
two behind
pinky holding it down thumb holding it
nice and flat the flatter the vegetables
the more confident you are when you
slice so
don't worry about the speed
just let the knife do the work
and take your time
speed comes
the most important thing
is to get your technique right
red onion
now sweet sour peppers
olive oil in
[Music]
i'm going to saute them which is just
the chef's turn for shallow frying on a
high heat for maximum taste
some salt
and pepper
add a tablespoon of sugar sugar helps to
break down the peppers quicker but
caramelize the onions frying them in a
frying pan perfect it's one of the sort
of basic essential tools of any kitchen
because it's so multi-purpose great for
sauteing
tossing
great for cooking fish on meat
push away and pull back push away and
pull back that hissing is something you
need to hear constantly because
the minute that's gone your peppers and
your onions start to boil and you really
want them to soak it you now start to
see it glistening in a way that it's
starting to caramelize sugar's working
beautifully
that's ready for the red wine vinegar
in
smells incredible it helps to stain the
peppers as well look at the glaze now
you can see the sugar
it's worked it's magic
turn down the gas and add a couple of
tablespoons of fresh
extra virgin olive
oil let them stew for two to three
minutes
now i want to make the peppers nice and
light and sort of sweet aromatic just
roll the basil
almost like a big cigar
slice
basil in
and then literally cook it out for 30
seconds
i want them off
beautiful
okay pan back on
now for the pork chops
i want to make sure
they don't curl up in the pan they start
curling up in the pan they're going to
cook unevenly
a few simple cuts through the rind means
the chop stays flat and cooks evenly
point the knife down
flip through it's seasoned them
beautifully
nice large
shards of pepper punch that through
lightly guaranteed that seasoning
is gonna stay there
hot pan touch garlic and touch of thyme
the garlic
take a couple of cloves
don't peel it don't chop it just knife
on
crush it
olive oil in
just starting to smoke
top of the chop
in
and lay away from me
nice
keep that heat in the pan
put the garlic in there early
a nice fragrant bunch of thyme
see how the pork is staying nice and
flat
turn that over look at that beautiful
i want a little bit of thyme underneath
there
start squeezing that garlic out i want
the flavor coming out
butter in
thin slices of butter
till the pan and baste
so i'm sort of speeding up the cooking
process at the same time i'm keeping the
pork chop really nice and moist and now
look at the color of that butter it's
almost like sort of a nut brown
check the color on the other side useful
when they're that thick
three and a half to four minutes each
side
30 seconds from now they're going to be
medium so i'm going to take them out and
let them rest
the secret to perfectly moist pork chops
is letting them rest almost as long as
they're cooked in the pan
[Music]
a nice spoon
of these peppers the basil smells
incredible
keep that garlic on there be generous
with that vinaigrette from the peppers
because it really is incredible
do two things simple like that pork and
peppers
and your confidence is going to shoot
through the roof a stunning pork chop
with sweet and sour peppers

absolutely delicious dishes beautiful
coming up on my ultimate cookery course
along with 100 recipes to stake your
life on i'm going to give you 100 quick
cooking tips to make your life in the
kitchen easier
first up how to keep your knife sharp
it's far harder working in the kitchen
with a blunt knife than it is with a
sharp knife the secret behind keeping a
sharp knife sharpen it before and every
time you use it first grip the steel
feel really comfortable about holding
the still imagine you're holding a
tennis racket or you're playing squash
you've got to be really comfortable with
it now 45 degrees confident grip
confident grip with the knife this is
the butt of the steel really important
you keep your fingers behind there you
never grip a steel with your fingers
over that because the knife comes back
in you've just lost a finger always grip
behind
nice long strokes so we get the whole of
the blade
over still
stroke
and we start from the bottom to the top
so there
across
there
across
slow strokes over the top of the steel
and then come back underneath
then back in the knees
it is so dangerous working in the
kitchen with a blunt knife you can cause
so much damage working with a sharp
knife is 10 times quicker more efficient
now
that's ready to start chopping
to stop your chopping board rocking or
slipping a great tip is to simply wet a
kitchen cloth kitchen paper or tea towel
and place it underneath
now you can chop with confidence
[Music]
my next top tip is get the most out of
your humble veg peeler
it's brilliant for slicing ultra thin
ribbons or veg perfect for asian dishes
great for making long delicate parmesan
shavings to top soups and salads
it also makes wonderful chocolate curls

your pepper mill is more versatile than
you might think
tighten the top screw to get finely
ground pepper ideal for soups and sauces
[Music]
for general seasoning you want it medium
ground so set the screw in the middle
and loosen it right off for coarse
pepper perfect for steaks and fish
[Music]
peeling garlic for one clove simply bash
it with the back of a knife and the skin
comes off easily
for a whole head crush separate into a
bowl
cover and shake hard for about 10
seconds
then simply pick out the peeled cloves
[Music]
this is my ultimate cookery course 100
recipes to stake your life on
i'll be showing you a roast chicken
recipe to die for hold the drum and
slice straight through
but first like any good chef i'm always
looking to get great ingredients at the
right price
my shopping mantra is simple first rely
on your senses make sure whatever you're
buying it looks smells and really feels
good and if you get the chance taste it
before you buy it second is to recognize
that knowledge is crucial the more you
know about where your ingredients come
from and how they produce the better so
ask lots of questions and learn

you're never too old to learn from
experts and when it comes to buying
great birds one person knows what to
look for is award-winning fifth
generation master butcher danny lid gain
poultry is a great meat because there's
many different types of birds it's worth
tasting the variation of flavours
between different birds to birds is
massive
turkey's a great lean meat that's
available all year round not just for
christmas anybody who's worried about
eating fatty meats it's a really healthy
flavoursome meal
game birds people don't try them often
enough once they're shot they're hung up
for a little while but a few days at
least it means the meat's going to be
more tender it all adds flavor to the
birds
we've got a wood pigeon and a red leg
partridge both really good and cook
really quickly
when you're buying a chicken some of the
things to look out for is obviously the
smell
and when you're smelling a good quality
chicken you can tell the difference the
skin's a nice white color and it smells
like a fresh chickeny smell
when you're buying from a good butcher
you'll find you tend to get the giblets
as well which is basically the neck and
other organs this is great for making
gravy once you have cooked it you can
use all the offcuts for other things
stir fries curries pasta dishes save the
bones use the bones for stocks and soups
they're really packed full of flavor
and remember there are lots of different
breeds of chicken all have different
characteristics and flavors so shop
around and find the ones you love here
are three of my all-time favorites
the label anglais
these come from an old british breed
they've got smaller breasts but the
meat's delicious
the black leg a fantastic french variety
succulent with bags of flavour and
really meaty thighs
and the pulley device this is the rolls
royce of chickens rich gamey and
delicious one for special occasions

i think people should maybe try and buy
less meat but aim for the best quality
you're only going to get out what you
put in by putting the best quality into
a dish you're going to get the best
results
no matter how seasoned the chef you are
there are always new ingredients and
recipes to get fired up about
so if a tired old recipe is getting you
down spice it up with fresh ideas and
flavors
my next recipe is an old classic roast
chicken but with a simple twist it takes
on a new life and it's guaranteed to
impress
one of the things i love about cooking
and that keeps me excited after 25 years
behind the stove is that there's always
something new to learn every day new
ingredients new techniques and new
cuisines
start off with the stuffing
it's amazing how exciting a stuffed
roast chicken can be because it keeps
the chicken incredibly moist and gives a
delicious texture inside the bird
i'm going to start off with cured
cerrito this is a traditional spanish
sausage
and it's
garlicky spicy incredibly meaty
that gives a little bit of sort of
richness to the stuffing
get our chriso in
start cooking that down and getting all
those oils out
a little touch of olive oil in there to
get it going right onions
chopped
add the onions to the cerezo and in a
matter of seconds they'll change color
as they soak up all the flavor
that lovely spiciness has been stolen
from that sausage now the onions smell
incredible
garlic
garlicky
fresh thyme just hold it down and put
your fingers on there and it's a really
nice way of taking off all those nice
fragrant little time flowers
you can hear it crackling in the
background
these are cannellini beans
they're waxy
very soft
not so delicious but very dense
but for stuffing they're so robust
nothing breaks down drain them off
in
they're going to take on all that juice
as well from the freezer i'm going to
season them now because they're very
dense so it needs some help
i mean that looks like it's
a dish on its own
good enough to eat now
i want to sweeten things up a little bit
tomatoes half dried
in
that sweetens up
the stuffing
beautiful
the stuffing's ready look at the color
everything
looks spanish it looks delicious
now
stuffing the chicken i like taking off
these little knuckles
as the chicken cooks the skin stretches
over the bone you can get a really nice
drum and take off those little wing tips
as well
salt pepper
so important
now
you're stuffing
i'm gonna go right inside the chicken
push it down this really helps to cook
the bird evenly because you're pushing
out all the empty spaces in the carcass
and take a nice large lemon
push the lemon in
pick up the person's nose pull the skin
over
olive oil on top
salt
and pepper
a teaspoon of paprika
sprinkle it on and then get your hands
and sort of
rub that in
let's see what the paprika is doing to
the chicken putting this like sweet
spicy marinade
it's not even roasted yet but it looks
delicious
[Music]
400ml of white wine same quantity of
water that helps the chicken to steam
chicken in
be generous with the time sprigs
[Music]
make sure the fall is folded tightly
around the roasting tray so the chicken
steams in the oven keeping it moist and
juicy
into the oven
[Music]
cook for one hour at 180 degrees with a
foil on nice take it out and remove the
full lid then give it another 30 minutes
to crisp up that skin
[Music]
look at that
it's so important to make sure you take
that tin foil off with half an hour to
go
beautiful
pierce that open
squeeze it in
that delicious gravy mix that into the
tray
and sieve that
that's really nice fragrant lemony
spiced roasting juices to finish
before we cut up the chicken take out
amazing stuffing
[Music]
incredible i'd have that with chicken
over potatoes any day
and then just get your chicken roasting
juices
now
to cut the chicken up
hold the drum
and slice straight through
and there's a wonderful drum and the
thigh through the wishbone
off
slice with the point at an angle so you
can see the texture
of that amazing rice chicken
just take my cooking juices just want to
give a really nice sort of lemony
flavor
over my chicken and there you go
a delicious
very charming stuffed
roast chicken

cooking should never be a chore the more

that way you actually start to enjoy it
and that's the key to good cooking have
a bit of fun along the way
this is minced beef and minced pork the
pork needs to sit in there otherwise the
going to dry out
really important to season the mints
before you cook it
pan nice and hot
a touch of olive oil
mince in
breaking up like that really helps to
sort of separate it so we can fry it off
with a lot of color
with your spoon
just go through
[Music]
and start breaking that up
the most important thing to remember is
mint is made up of cheap cuts brisket
belly
short rib so
it needs help
and frying off the mince for color is so
important
if this pan wasn't hot your mince is
going to boil there's a horrible gray
color on there
and there's no flavor on your mince
taste a little bit
[Music]
tastes delicious it's seasoned
beautifully see how crispy it's going
take it
much further than you've ever taken
mince before nice and crispy

How to Make Frozen Hot Choocolate,25-02-2013,Nate Harms,"hi everyone today I'm going to show you
how to make one of my all-time favorite
drinks if you like chocolate you're sure
to love this I'm sure many of you have
had the classic hot chocolate on a cold
winter's day but have you thought about
switching it up and having frozen hot
chocolate on a hot date to cool you off
I have been making this drink since I
was about 12 years old and I've
perfected it over time today I'm going
to show you how to make frozen hot
chocolate with minimal ingredients that
you should just have laying around your
house
I always showing you how to prepare your
work area how to make the actual frozen
hot chocolate and then how to add a
little bit of your own taste to make it
the way you want it first it's important
to clean off your workspace and where
you're going to be making it according
to Mads article on WebMD website it
states that the kitchen is actually the
dirtiest room in your house even dirtier
than your bathroom so it's important to
clean off the area to make sure that you
don't get germs in what you're making
next you will need to get all of your
ingredients together today I'm using my
mom's recipe that has minimal
ingredients required so today all we
will need is some whipped cream about 25
ounces of ice half a cup to a cup of
sugar depending on how sweet you want it
and then I did about a cup and a half of
milk and then two packets of hot
chocolate mix and lastly some syrup and
now there are work areas clean and we
have all of our stuff prepared we can
start to make it first we're going to
dump all the ice into the blender

I might use a little less and just do
half of what we have and then we're
going to put the sugar in there and then

the milk send the packets go hot

chocolate

and now that all of our ingredients are
in here we are ready to blend so we're
going to blend it for about a minute or
a little less depending on how you want
the consistency

okay
now we're going to pour it in the cups

okay so now I'll show you how to add a
little appeal to your drink and these
cups aren't completely follow they're a
little disproportionate but we're going
to add some whipped cream and some
chocolate syrup to the top of them so
we'll just add a little bit of beech and

some chocolate

all right and now you can enjoy your
frozen hot chocolate in some hot weather
or some cold weather if you live in
North Dakota
today I have showed you how to make
frozen hot chocolate at home with just a
few simple ingredients first you learned
how to clean your workspace area then
you learn how to make back to a frozen
hot chocolate and lastly you learned how
to add a little more spice to it by
using your own little ingredients at the
end
now don't forget this isn't the only
recipe out there you can find recipes
online my favorite is serendipity 3 use
frozen hot chocolate and you can do that
and go out there and find them and
you'll do great

Braids,27-02-2013,Hannah Poppe,"we all know throughout the years there
have been many different hairstyles the
mullet the Bob beehive in the perm they
all had their day although some are
better than others they were all
influential today most of us have
noticed braids a new hairstyle as a
member of trick society trying to keep
up with all the new trends I've spent
countless hours trying to learn these
new and upcoming hairstyles today I'm
here to show you just a few different
ways you can braid your hair first I'm
going to start with the one and only
classic braid the classic braid is
probably the easy spread of all of them
you start with the hair in just
basically a ponytail you divide into
three even sections of hair one two
three and basically it's the same
pattern throughout the whole braid so
you're going to take the outside strand
which is the right in my right hand
cross over the middle then you're going
to take the other outside strand cross
over the now middle which was before the
right stranded and then you're going to
go right over middle left over middle
right over middle and it's pretty simple
usually boys can actually do this braid
the braid when you finish the classic
braid you'll tie it with a ponytail
carry will now show us what the finished
classic braid actually looks like her
hair is really thick so she has thicker
strands of hair throughout the braid
although the classic braid is very
simple it paved the way to more complex
brains although one is called the French
braid is not actually French all it
actually originated from the North
Africa it is called the French braid
because France is associated with high
living and so they thought it was a
classy more elegant braid so that's how
that got started for the French braid
you will start at the crown of the head
and some people can start you can start
up here too but and also some people
French braids in about the bangs of the
brave' the hair but I'm going to start
at the crown just a classic French braid
you're going to split the hair into
three pieces this is more difficult than
the classic braids it has more elements
to it let's put the hair into three even
sections of the crown then you're going
to scoop up hair from each side combine
it with the outer which is in my right
hand outer strand cross up the middle so
it's kind of like the classic braid in
that way also then you're going to take
the other side of hair combine it with
the outside braid and again cross over
the middle you're going to keep going
until you reach the end and again I'm
going to cross this over it's just the
same pattern throughout it's a little
difficult to learn it first but I
actually kind of taught myself I used to
practice on my Barbie's for the French
braid once you get about two here you
won't have any more strands to pull in
from the side so you're going to have to
just finish the whole braid with a
classic braid and again tied hair with a
ponytail Krista has a finished French
braid on our hair which starts up here
as you can tell at the crown and as it
gets to about here there's no more hair
to pull in from the side so she has to
finish with a classic braid and again
ties it at the end with a ponytail the
classic and French braids have been used
for a long period of time but recently a
new style of braid has emerged and that
is called the fishtail the fishtail
looks very complex and it's difficult
and I thought it was going to be
difficult before I learned how to do it
but actually once you did down it's
almost as easy as the classic braid it
doesn't have as many thumb elements so
to start with the fish for it fishtail
braid you're going to
start with a hair in a ponytail
basically you're going to split it into
two again
and from the right side you're going to
take a little strip of hair cross it
over the middle over the right strand
and you can combine it with the other
strand of hair in the left hand that I
have here also then you're going to take
the other side do the same step but make
sure this is combined to step the string
that you crossed over you're going to
make sure that it is combined with the
left strand that you did cross over the
newly pulled strain into the other
strand of hair kind of hard to keep it
all together sometimes because it falls
out you got to make sure it's really
tight or else it won't stay so then just
keep going down and you're just going to

keep pulling just average sections of
hair almost like an inch thick of hair
throughout the middle her hair is kind
of easy for this to do because it's so
thick and easily done okay so basically
sometimes you can tie it here just leave
it like that that's actually kind of a
pretty style but also when you get to
the end you're going to just keep going
down down down to down until you finish
with the whole entire fishtail braid
you're going to knot it with a ponytail
actually has the fishtail braid
her hair's a little thinner so her
strands are a little skinnier and her
braid is a little loose here just
because her hair so thin then it won't
stay into the loop but that's about it
so the size make changed throughout the
years the braids are here to stay JV
today I gave you a little insight in the
numerous food that can be accomplished
other complex other complex braids
include the mermaid braid
inside-out braid five strand braid and
many more although many braids are very
challenging with a little practice and
repetition
you'll be a brave master happy Brady",Demonstrative
How to Apply First Aid,07-05-2013,David Nguyen,"on the cutter scrape and then started
bleeding or you just freak out because
oh what do i do what do i do i'm sure
we've all been there and all throughout
life we go through experiences that
leave us with these kind of injuries and
whether it be cooking in the kitchen
riding a bicycle or even just walking
down the street accidents can happen and
as a wild child i've gotten a lot of
cuts and scrapes and i've experienced
the kids and bads and taking care of all
these injuries i've learned that through
these experiences there's a proper way
to take care of cuts and scrapes
and um
in order to properly take care of them
it takes an easy three-step process it's
prep
cleaning and dressing
and let's go to the first step of the
process
the first step of the process is to take
the necessary precautions in order to
prevent the injury from being
contaminated by outside germs or
bacteria that can cause infection and
there's a couple universal precautions
that professionals like to use in order
to prevent these kind of things from
happening the first off is to use
protective gear the first thing you can
do is um
you either invite in most minor cases
all you really need would be some hand
sanitizer or vinyl latex gloves or even
like a face mask and what this does is
it prevents the exchange of bodily
fluids which can spread germs and
bacteria and then another actually the
most important thing to do before is to
clean your hands wash your hands before
and after dealing with any kind of open
wound because like i said that can cause
spread of germs or bacteria cause
infection
after you've done the right or after
you've taken the necessary precautions
you can easily move on to
handling the wound itself and
the next step of the process is to clean
the wound
in any situation most of the time cuts
and scrapes will they'll be bleeding it
just occurs naturally and it's not
something you have to worry about too
much it's just before you start doing
any cleaning you have to stop the
bleeding to do that
all you have to do is apply direct
pressure to the wound so if this was a
bleeding wound you could get some gauze
usually some kind of absorb material a
napkin
a paper towel or
you know a piece of clothing if you
don't have anything like that and just
apply direct pressure
that cool that will help slow the flow
of bleeding and help your blood clot and
eventually it'll stop bleeding
altogether another thing you can do is
to raise the injury above the heart what
this does is it uses gravity to slow the
flow of blood away from the injury site
so if you have your leg if you lift it
above your heart if you don't just do
this and yeah slowing the flow of blood
or blood will help to clot the blood as
well
and then oh the last part of slowing the
flow of blood is to use pressure points
pressure points are arteries that are
near the surface of the skin um and you
can cut you can use them to restrict
blood flow kind of like stepping on your
garden hose you notice a deep decrease
in flow of water and there are three
main points the first point is on your
inner arm between your elbow and your
shoulder right here another point would
be in between your groin and your knee
on your inner thigh right here and the
last point would be behind the knee
and after you stop the bleeding you can
finally move on to actually actually
cleaning the wound and it's pretty easy
process it's the most
it's the more simple process out of the
cleaning or the prepping or anything
like that
all you have to do is simply
take off the paper or whatever you're
using
rinse your injury under soap or under
running water you can use soap if you
want you don't have to so you just rinse
real quick make sure to let it dry
that way you don't deal with the wet
injury
after this
oh actually in some cases people like to
use hydrogen peroxide maybe you fall in
the dirt you get a cut from something
like that and you want to use this to
clean
all of your uh or to kill any bacteria
or germs that may be left in the injury
but once you've done
once you've finished cleaning your wound
the next thing to do simply is to apply
a bandage
the third step of this process the
bandage or the dressing
it helps to
prevent or it helps the process of
healing for your injuries and what this
can do is to actually

what this can do to help you is it'll
isolate the injury from any further
contaminants
same concept as before so you don't have
any germs or new bacteria being
introduced to the wound site uh it also
helps with cuts to have a bandage so
that you don't have like the wound to
reopen
and then the third is that if you in the
case that you want to use an antibiotic
ointment
it'll prevent that from rubbing onto
your clothing and so all you really have
to do this could even be easier than
cleaning essentially you just find the
right size band-aid
you put it on the wound
and there you go but in cases where like
this one it's a really large wound you
could go and grab
gauze or another sanitary piece of cloth
put it on the wound again
and then secure it with some medical
tape because medical tape is actually
designed to stick to your skin
and so once you've done this
you've pretty much completed your job
and so let's review real quick the first
thing to do is to make sure that you
prep yourself by keeping yourself clean
or cleaning yourself afterwards then you
clean the wound you stop the bleeding
rinse everything off and last you just
apply a bandage
and if you use this easy three-step
process you can you can avoid any
further contaminants or complications of
injury and i mean things happen every
day you know accidents can happen with
all the crazy things going on like you
never know what might happen you never
know if you need first aid and so next
time you find yourself in this kind of
situation where it's like oh no
am i ready to do this can i hurt or can
i heal myself you can say yeah i'm
totally ready one of the cases where
it's like a major injury
just call that one one instead",Demonstrative
How to solve the Rubik's cube,18-03-2013,MrIAmRon,"here's any does anyone not know what
this is yeah it's a Rubik's Cube I bet
some of you probably have one at home is
it not a bookshop except it doesn't look
like this
Maya looks up more like like this right
has for years well I haven't been some
of the rivers cube for over four years
and in that time insolvent what a 15,000
times after my demonstration today are
you going to be able to solve the
Rubik's Cube no probably not
and the reason for that is that it
requires algorithms and let your math
major no one likes the word algorithm
but in regards to the Rubik's Cube
it's simply just a series of moves and
turns that you do on it that does not
mess up previously small pieces behind
me is a site that includes all the
different algorithms they would take way
too long for me to show you all the
different algorithms
to all the different patterns so instead
I'm going to show you the process of
solving a rubik's cube so that you know
where to start and where to end I would
hope you know where to end that's when
it's solved you don't want to go further
than that so so let's begin on the first
stage of some of the rubik's cube you
want to solve for the white cross when
you solve the white cross you want the
edge pieces to match the colors of the
layer above it so i'm gonna go ahead and
do this now this stuff here does not
require any type of advanced algorithms
most people can think up a rubik's cube
and solve this in a matter of a couple
minutes so once that's done that was
pretty easy at stage 1 stage 2 now is to
solve was called the first two layers or
about two now that's all been the corner
piece in the edge piece of these first
two layers at the same time although
this process takes the most amount of
time overall it's faster than solving
the individual
and then match pieces this stage is a
little bit complicated in I've been
trying to speak and do it at the same
time but it's difficult so please bear
with me while I like well I saw this

and then a complete stage to is solving
the first two layers finally we run the
last stage and that solving the top what
you want to do on this stage is first
start with a yellow cross and the yellow
cross is different than solving a white
because you it does not matter that
colors match on the edges so you just
want to get the white cross such as that
next you want to get all yellow to be
positioned on top

I have to warn you when you start doing
the algorithms on the last layer they
become longer and more difficult to do
and if you mess up midstream you end up
really having to start back over it with
stage 1 switch I have to mess up if you
follow some of algorithms ok so now you
can see that the the signs are all kind
of messed up there's two corners that
are where they need to be there's two
corners that are not so we need to get
all the corners in its respective
positions okay so now all the corners

are really need to be you can see the
very last step of stage three is to get
the edge pieces properly aligned to
where they need to be done it been this
off and and to recap them the first

stage is to get the white cross the
second stage is then to solve the first
two layers and then finally solve the
top those three stage it is along with
the algorithms you can find on the
website behind II well have you solved
the Rubik's Cube in no time so I talked
about you should go home grab that
Rubik's Cube on the your bookshelf or go
out and buy one and start solving it
today and now even open for questions
opener - Wow all right

twenty point seven seconds just like 40

seconds like about four years I was

gonna had a hand in three sauces doing
it for therapy
I'd be faster if my hand I have like a
little gimpy and sort of I'd be faster
that worked better
yeah those guys are good like the

fastest time is five point five five
seconds yeah I used to take it apart

no I can do if I see a pattern I can do
a few moves
without looking at it some people can do
that hoagies like that
yeah this is a 5x5 and I have a 4x4 as

well the 4x4 is a little different than
five five five to center pieces like a
3x3 they don't move like this piece can
never be turned you know it's
always going to stay there well for five
for the centerpieces can't move so you
have to first get the centerpieces right

Easy Card Trick,05-04-2016,McMelvins,"a man named Lemony Snicket once quoted
everyone should be able to do one card
trick tell two jokes and recite three
poems
if you're ever trapped in an elevator
how do you think you could do that all
right step above me I don't think I have
bones down well I'm gonna show you a
simple card trick to use on friends
family co-workers and even your enemies
yes your enemies look into that a little
bit here though they get started I'll
need a victim from the audience I'll
take you could you please come up and I
have a deck of 52 cards here just your
average Barack Obama deck of cards
take out the two jokers all right I show

sleeves are clean
nothing up on nothing to hide all right

now I'm gonna take this deck cards I
don't want you to tell me where to stop
stop okay remember that card

nice right yeah Marietta China a little
more time I'll give you another quick

shuffle for you all right tell me I'm

gonna stop one more time stop got the

card

can you see the consummate yeah

all right okay yeah ask your victim to

shuffle the deck and shuffle before you
take it back - now here's the most
important step you'll screw everything
up if you don't do this when he's
handing back the deck to you you take a
real quick look at that bottom card that
is the card that you are always paying
attention to so now here's the next
important step take the deck in your
hand just like so face down
don't let it really sit on the palm and
then you ask the victim to start
counting you start shuffling the card
you don't want to stop so as I'm going
you'll say stop then when he says stop
throw your thumb right underneath and
pull that car down - oh right - it's

that simple just a quick sleight of hand
1 2 3 well as you can see you go through

it a couple times I went through it the
first time in short I'm just did it
right up you know say his card was the
you know we'll say the Jack of Hearts I
was throwing them up throwing them off
Jack's part showed right away I called
it out right away so then you do the
card trick again same thing don't miss
any steps to everything there but then
again when you're laying your cards down
say his card is the knight of Hearts
you're laying them down you're laying it
down you lay the nine of Hearts down but
keep putting cards down over it just
leave that nine of Hearts sticking out a
little bit so you can see it and then
you make a little wager say hey
you want to make this interesting and
when when they say yes let's make it
interesting
they're off whatever you want to bet
this is where your enemies come in they
can $10 bet 2000 bet you really want
this amount and then make sure you do
not point to the cards when you say
let's make a wager as soon as you point
to a card you have to pick that card so
that's why you do not point to the car
as soon as I make the wager simply turn
that card over show to like your money
and if they don't take that wager though
just simply flip over the wrong card and
show that you got around and if you want
you can try your luck do one more time
play the same wager but then slip this
card so what's the essence or you finish
almost so there you have it a simple
card trick to entertain your friends
family the enemies and even those
randoms you're gonna meet the elevator",Demonstrative
Wrapping a Present,11-11-2015,Maggie House,"hi guys so presents have been around for
her really long time and they're used
for just about anything and everything
like Christmas and birthdays
anniversaries and graduation just really
there you can give a present for any
convocation and so today I'm going to
show you how to wrap a present which is
something that everybody should know how
to do so what you're going to need is a
pair of scissors you're gonna need some
tape wrapping paper and obviously the

present so I'm to get started you're
just going to roll out your wrapping
paper okay and then you're gonna set
your present on top and you're just
going to pull the ends of the wrapping
paper over just about halfway or a
little over it doesn't really matter and
then you're going to take this end and
you're just going to wrap it around just
to see how much more paper you're gonna
need to cover the other side so once you
get it measured out you're gonna take
your scissors and okay so now we're

ready to start the wrapping process now
when you're wrapping something like this
in a box or something I always flip it
upside down because when you go to open
it you don't want the crease to be on
the top so then you open it and you're
looking at the bottom of it so I always
flip it upside down so that the crease
have the paper will be on the bottom of
the prints so and just wrap that over
kind of like this now you're just going

to get your piece of tape and just take

that so that it is secure okay now pour

wrapping the ends that gets a little bit
trickier so and just press the paper
down like this and we're going to make a
crease so push it down all the way and

then it will kind of fold itself once
you start pressing it down and it will
just kind of pull into a little triangle
I guess okay so now we're going to press

it up against the base of the present
and just give it a good crease so that
it stays and it should make a triangle
shape and it kind of comes up over the
present so what I like to do is I just
bend it down just a little bit so that
looks a little bit neater and you just
fold that up and then again we're going
to take the tape and just tape the top
and if you need to you can also take the
sides if it's not secure so then again
on the other end you can see how has a
lot of excess paper to the present stops
right so if you need to you can just you

have the harder it is to track your
present so another way that you can
this is just gonna bring in the sides
like this
and you can see there's a triangle on
the top and now there's triangle on the
ball so you're just going to crease the
bottom and kind of crease the top okay

so now you've got triangle on top turn
on bottom we're gonna take the top part
and just press it down completely
against the side and then take the top
part and you see out overlap so just
fold it just so it doesn't overlap the
top of the pattern and then finish it

off with some tape and there you have it
so and hopefully now I've helped you out
and now you can wrap a present for your
boyfriend girlfriend brother sister mom
or dad and I'm sure they'll love it yes",Demonstrative
Self Defense,08-04-2015,Kaleigh Newman,"according to the FBI a violent crime
occurs every 26 seconds this means about
the NMS Beach 14 people will have fallen
victim to various violent crimes for
those could be sexual assault seven to
eight assault and battery in the
remaining few arranged for murder car
theft and burglary we were out walking
around sometimes we see an ominous
figure and become apparently the
well-being of our friends and family
along with ourselves is one of the most
important things in life if you knew
that your friends and family could
defend themselves wouldn't I bring you a
greater peace of mind
well my senior year of high school I had
a computer project with the goal of
learning a new skill or doing something
for my community I was going to host a
self-defense class for the men and women
in my area I had the Bossier Parish
Sheriff's Office come out to a Miller
Baptist and teach basic self-defense
moves to the participants today I would
like to explain to y'all a few ways to
avoid an attack or to fought off your
attacker if you are attacked first let's
start with the most important thing
taking away an opportunity for you to
become a victim the first thing you want
to do is never walk around headphones in
your ears if you have music playing you
cannot hear what is going on around you
and you cannot be aware of your
surroundings you never want to carry too
many bags on your arms it will limit
your mobility you will not be able to
fight off your attacker or run away
lastly if you do not want to isolate
yourself but if you do have to isolate
yourself in a public place you want to
walk with the purpose a wanderer makes
themselves a target if an attacker
approaches you in demanding and demand
something give it to them nothing is
more valuable than your life if they
want your wallet or purse you should
throw it one direction and run the other
way if you have a buggy or a shopping
cart use that to your advantage
put it between you and the attacker to
create space you should also scream and
yell and do anything you can to draw
attention you do not want to be alone
with your attacker but if worse comes to
worse and you are intact there are some
simple moves you can do to funnel
through attacker first your attacker may
try to restrain you from behind if they
do this one move you can do is strike
them in the shin there is a nerve
located right here that you want to
strike so if they're following you from
behind you want to pick up your foot and
drive back
at a downward angle the next thing you
can do is headbutt them they're holding
you you want to take your head and slam
it backwards into their face you want to
try to hit their nose but if you don't
that's okay the next thing you can do is
use your elbows if you can make your
elbows you want to destroy your your
Tucker in this time if your attacker is
a male you want to hit him in the groin
because that is the most effective way
to fight off the man your attacker may
also want to grab you around the neck if
they do this you want to tuck your chin
like so this will prevent them from
cutting off your Airways and you'll be
able to breathe if your attacker attacks
you from the front and restraint you you
can use your foot again you want you to
start downward at their shin you can
also have about your attacker this time
you want to use a portion of your head
where your skin meets your hairline once
you try to get your attacker and your
nose or the eyes is any one of the most
sensitive areas and they will usually
back away if your attacker is very close
do not close this face yourself but if
they're close you can grab them on the
shores pull them downward they want to
drive your knee into their stomach if
your attacker is a male you want to hit
them in the groin again your attacker
may also try to restrain you by grabbing
your neck if they grab your neck with
one hand you can use the hand on the
same side of the body and put it inside
their arm you want to drive up work with
your arm to force their hands off of
your neck in their arms off your
shoulder you can also use those hands or
warning it if you like to grab their arm
and pull away from your neck this part
of their grip between their thumb in the
corner is going to be the weakest part
if your attacker grabs you with two
hands you want to put your hands
together like your friend put them
between their arms and drive upper this
will force their hands off of your neck
the most important thing is to not panic
if they have your neck I know you want
to grab their hands and pull off your
neck but remain calm each breath you
take is going to be a precious breath so
if you are detect what we do let's
repeat the basic steps for a morning
attack and fighting off your
hacker first you want to take away any
opportunity for being attacked you want
to remain vigilant and aware of your
surroundings but if you are attacked and
we strengthen behind you can use your
foot your head or your elbows to strike
your attacker and fight them off if you
are restrained from the front you can
use your foot your head or your knees to
strike your attacker and fight them off
if your attacker grabs you with one hand
to choke you you can drive your hand
upward to force their hand off your neck
or you can grab their hand with both
hands and pull their hand off of your
neck if they use two hands you want to
put your hands together and thrust
upward so today I have taught you how to
avoid an attack and fight off your
attacker but many people think that they
would not be able to fight off their
attacker

life depends on it the human body can do

Crayon Art,22-03-2013,Katlyn Hillanbrand,"hi my name is Katie and this is my
demonstration speech and this is my
audience

okay so today I'm going to show you how
to make this is what the final thing
will look like once you make it okay so
first I want to go over the materials
and then the process and I think that a
good reason to make crown art it's just
it's a fun craft to do if you have time
on your hands and if you just want to
make something neat that you can hang in
your room this would be a great idea
okay so first the materials you're going
to need is a blank canvas obviously a

box of crowns and it really did its best
to use Crayola crowns and it doesn't
matter what color she used because you
can you can organize it however you want
you're gonna need a hot glue gun with
glue sticks a hand dryer which is one of
the most important things and if you
want to be decorative
like I did here you can put a silhouette
with an umbrella to make it look like
it's raining so I have a silhouette
which I'm going to glue down and then
you use this as a protective cover so
you're gonna need this and then take to
tape it down okay
so the first step is to get all your
materials together and you lay down your
canvas then you're gonna pick up your
Crown's that you're going to use and you
can use whatever colors you want or you
can organize organize them like the
rainbow and I am used to the step that I
was taught when I was younger for gif
like red orange yellow green blue indigo
violet to to lay mine down so it would
kind of look like it went well because
like if you have red and then blue and
then orange it's just gonna look all
messy so what you do is you will lay
them out in the order that you want them
in and you're gonna lay them out on the
edge and once you get all of the colors
that you need laid out you're gonna have
to go back and peel each individual
crown in that order but I think it's
best to lay them out first to see if it
looks as well
okay so once you peel all of the crowns
off you're gonna then have to get your
hot glue gun and glue each one down
individually like like they're on here
because the paper is gonna be peeled off
so then you just blue one at a time and
go down and go down the list okay once
you have that that's when I tend to glue
on my silhouette and you just take
Elmer's glue or you can use a glue stick
and you'll just glue it down on your
thing and once you have that you see
there's gonna be the umbrella you use
this to guard the umbrella
so once the crowns are melting down it
won't go on top of the umbrella because
that defeats the purpose so then you use
your tape and you make a little covering
like this and you tape it down so once
you have that you pretty much have
everything done and now you get to the
melting part so to melt the crowns
obviously you're gonna eat your
hairdryer so once you plug your
hairdryer in you gonna you can turn it
on low or high whichever you want
because it's really just the heat that's
gonna do it I prefer to use it on high
because I feel it it melts the crowns
quicker and what you're gonna do is
you're gonna just hover over the crowns
add a you shouldn't be too close but
it's not good to be too far away because
then the heat won't really reach it so
you're gonna do this and it's gonna take
a while for it just kick in for the heat
to actually settle and I tend to keep it
on one area at a time because it's gonna
make it melt quicker and and it's just
gonna start to drip and you can keep it
on there for however long you want how
much you want it to drip and then your
final product will be this so that is

how you make crown art",Demonstrative

salt onion powder paprika
and garlic powder we will also be using

wash our hands to prevent the spread of
germs which i've already done
then we'll take eggs and put it inside
of a pot and then we'll go
ahead and add water to the car

next once you have enough water inside
the pot you go head over to the stove
and put it on medium high and cook that
for about five minutes
i've already had extra pad already so
what the next thing we'll do is
we'll begin to crack the egg

and we're going to start with peeling
the egg
to remove all the shells

you just want to be careful to make sure

Drawing Faces,12-10-2021,Izabella Stahlberger,"i'm going to start this off with a
question
who here has ever said or heard the
phrase oh no i can't draw that i can
only draw a stick figure
because as an artist of 10 years i am
also very guilty of that phrase however
do i believe those words
not at all i truly believe that anyone
can draw and i know as cliche as that
sounds i truly believe that i think with
the right motivation or inspiration to
create anyone can draw whatever they
want and that is why today i will
demonstrate to you
how to draw a face
now a lot of people may think that the
human face is very complex
which it is you're not wrong it
absolutely is however it's not as
complex as some people may think with
the tips and tricks i've picked up it
actually can be simplified so much so
that it is a lot less overwhelming and
it's pretty fun and pretty easy once you
get to learn
so my first tip
is called the rule of thirds something
that every beginner artist and expert
artist should know about
now with my visual
right here we have we see right here we
have the basic construct of a human face
now what we have here are horizontal and
vertical lines breaking up this face
which is what the rule of thirds is it's
taking an image and breaking it up into
simple pieces so that an artist can map
out where everything is going to go
which is amazing for the human face
now not many people know but a fun trick
i picked up is
to show you that the rule of thirds
works if you look if you actually broke
up my face right now although it is
asymmetrical if you look at the top my
eyes right here right they actually go
to the very top of my ears and then if
you draw the ears you actually see that
the bottom of my ears
go straight to my nose
so it's a matter of
just setting out a plane for everything
and mapping it out it's fascinating it
really is the rule of thirds is an
amazing tool that every artist should
use
nextly
we have shapes breaking things up into
shapes it's wonderful so if we see here
we have a cat right very complicated
very complex animals are incredibly hard
to draw but once you break it up into an
oval for the bottom half or for a square
for the upper half of the body a circle
for the face and triangles for the ears
it's a lot easier because they're basic
shapes and once you use basic shapes to
your advantage
it helps you draw
and lastly i want to say
for my third and final tip references
reference images like the ones i just
showed you are incredibly important some
people may think that that's stealing or
cheating absolutely not creating
something from your head is incredibly
difficult and so to have an image to
take as a reference and to help you
build upon what you have is very
important and no one should ever feel
ashamed for using a picture to help them
draw
and speaking of drawing time to take out
your pencil pen or paper and we are
going to see if my
tips and tricks actually come to the
test so
with my handy-dandy whiteboard and dry
erase marker we're gonna make this work
since i can't visually do it on a bigger
whiteboard or anything like that so to
start out we're gonna start out with
shaping which is a basic circle so i
want you all to draw a simple circle at
first
it doesn't have to be perfect because no
human face is perfect you know
again i've been drawing for 10 years and
even then my circles aren't perfect but
now we're going to start out with some
lines to break this up easier so we're
gonna break this into fourths so we're
gonna make one right down the middle
right here
and then one right across just like that
now right here is where our eyes are
gonna go so if you just wanna draw i'm
just gonna do some simple lines make
some grumpy eyes there you go
and of course right above the eyes we
have the eyebrows
now this isn't going to be the most
complex face in the in the long run it's
just going to be a simple breakdown of
how to draw one
next what i like to do is i like to draw
two straight lines
from from right here
from the very edge of your circle
which will lead down
into the cheekbones
like that something like that you know
again doesn't have to be perfect i'm
noticing more and more how imperfect
that is but it's all good it's all okay
because art again is a learning process
and it takes it takes practice you know
nextly we're going to draw a small
circle right down the middle right here
just a little circle right there
just like that
what i like to do is i also like to add
another little line right under here and
then we're going to take it
and we're going to add these like curved
lines if you want you can straighten
them and then smooth them out at the end
just for that extra little detail of a
chin
see that though we're kind of getting
there and it doesn't matter if it looks
uneven because i'm noticing mine does
too doesn't look good whatever it looks
like you know
so see we're using more lines or using
more shapes just to break this down
simply so what i like to do is i like to
add another line because this is going
to come in later
so
like i mentioned
right where your eyes are the top of
your ears are so we're going to add
some little like oh my marker
i'm going to add like some little ears
usually they're like fun little half
circles something like that
something like this you know
it can be big or small because again the
human face isn't perfect
all right and now we're gonna take these
the bottoms of these ears right
and we're gonna do that other line that
i was talking about something like that
just a straight line across
okay
perfect and right in between there see
where we have our chin line and our ear
line we erase this little part
and that is precisely where your mouth
would go right in the middle
that's so fascinating i love it it's
great
then we have
our mouth if you want to add some lips
you can you know
and then if you want i like to erase
this just to show you know there's our
chin
it's our mouth
it's crazy how that works now with our
ear line now we can even draw a nose
crazy how that works
everything just matches up all you have
to do
are you you have to use shaping
and lines and it just matches up
perfectly and lastly what we're going to
do is now we're going to take
your the very edge of your chin and
we're just gonna
draw down into a nice little neck
and there you go
you have a face
you have mostly like the proportions of
a face and yes it is a little slanted a
little crooked don't blame me it's a
little a little hard to draw like this
but
in the end that is how you draw a simple
face
and i hope that makes a lot of sense
with just making it up to just shapes
into simple lines anyone can draw
alright
have a good one",Demonstrative
 How To Enjoy Your Morning,11-11-2020,Dorothy Janting,"good morning people welcome to my video
and my name is dorothy

your morning
did you get up early did you get to do
everything that you want
or did you make yourself a good
breakfast
i know there's a lot of you out there
who is not a morning person but you want
to become one
so here i'm going to give you several
tips on how
to make your morning more enjoyable tips
number one
get enough sleep to start up your day
of course you will have to make sure
that
you wake up early to have enough time to
enjoy your morning
to wake up early you must make sure that
you get
enough sleep the night before in average
an adult should get at least 6 to 9
hours
worth of sleep while children need a
minimum of
8 hours try to go to bed before the
clock
strikes midnight and track your sleep
duration
using devices like smartwatch if you can
if you find that your favorite show
starts late in the night and you can't
stop yourself from watching
try to record the show if you have a
smart tv
or watch the encore of the episode from
the web
also make sure that you keep your
electronic devices away from you
one or two hours before going to sleep
tips number two drink plenty of water
as soon as you get up from bed get
yourself a tall glass of water
having a tall glass of water after you
wake up
helps to hydrate your body water also
helps to increase your
energy levels as it encourages the
production of
red blood cells in our body
which increases oxygen intake
to our brain therefore
you will have longer attention span
aside from that drinking water is the
first thing to do
in the morning helps to get you a better
complexion
and more radiant skin tips number three
meditate or go exercise
after waking up to the sound of your
blaring alarm
and drinking your water spend a good
10 to 15 minutes to meditate or do light
exercises
to freshen up your body there are
variety of
yoga exercises from youtube's fitness
channels that you can follow
which will give you a boost of energy
throughout the day
if you don't want to feel cramped out in
your house go outside for a walk
with your pet or even go alone not only
that this will make your morning more
enjoyable
but it will also make you a healthier
person
and more energetic tips number four
make yourself a cup of coffee having
your daily dose of caffeine
especially at the beginning of your day
sure give a boost towards your physical
performance just like water coffee also
helps to
keep you awake and stay focused
throughout the day
not only that it steers you away from
sleepiness
coffee also helps to burn fat as much
researchers claimed so
coffee also lowers the risk of internal
diseases
like heart attacks cancers and stroke
tips number five
plan your day having so many problems
and tasks to do but you don't know where
to start
don't worry sit down and take your
notebook and start to plan
your day write down everything that you
want to accomplish
that day and sort it out from the most
difficult ones
to the easiest one by doing so you can
focus
more at the beginning of the day and
relax a bit by the end of
it making a plan also ensures that you
will be able to spend your day
productively and avoid you from wasting
time so
grab your planners and start writing
your goals tips number six
eat a healthy breakfast breakfast
the first meal of the day it usually
ranges from a light one to a heavy one
instead of going for a heavy breakfast
like nasi lemak roti chennai or other
fried food
opt for a healthier version of them
there's plenty
of food they can supply of your body
with essential nutrients like veggies
fruits whole grain bread oatmeals
or even smoothies try to set a limit for
you to eat outside and start making your
own breakfast
more at home not only that it is
healthier
but it also helps save your budget i
know that there are
a lot of people out there who dislike
healthy breakfast
because they are not used to it and
healthy breakfast
is less icy than the heavy one but guess
what the less tastier it is
the healthier it is for your body
according to the dailymail.com
having a healthy breakfast can help to
reduce
any metabolic syndrome enhance your
immune system
improve your complexion and also prevent
you from over eating during lunch food
that is rich in fiber
like veggies and whole grains help to
keep you full for a longer period of
time
and also keep you from gaining weight
at once last but not least the final
tips for me to make your morning more
enjoyable
is to learn something new instead of
doing the same
boring routine and doing the things that
you are
already good at why don't you find
something new instead
try to explore and expand your talent by
moving out from your counter zone
you can learn to dance learn new
languages or if you have
never baked before go give it a try
look up for simple baking recipes online
and proceed to a harder one once you
have mastered all the basic techniques
or if you got so much free time in the
morning and you don't know what to do
try to learn sign languages go and
search for
easy and basic sign languages sheets
or videos for amateurs on the internet
better yet join an online class or an
actual class in the community that
teaches sign languages
we will never know when this talent will
come in handy in the future
needless to say there are hundreds of
ideas and ways to make your morning more
enjoyable
regardless of what they are the way you
want to spend your morning is
all accepted as long as it makes you
happy
these are my suggestions and i hope it
will give you a sign
and guide you a bit on how to spend your
morning

Mind Trick,29-08-2017,Ethan White,"hi everyone I meet the morning and I'm
gonna blow your mind
so first I want to start with picking a

number between 1 and 10 so I'm gonna
give you a few moments to pick a number
from 1 to 10 all right
once you've got that number you take
that number and multiply it by 2 then

you're gonna add it to 8 then you're
gonna divide it by 2 and once you've
done all those steps you take your
original number and subtract it from the
new number ok and once you get that new

number you're gonna find that number on
this little chart that I created and
you're gonna see which letter
corresponds with your number and once
you've found that letter I'm gonna give
you a couple moments because I want to
have you think of a country that begins
with that letter all right you got that
country okay good now take the last
letter of that country that you thought
of and think of an animal species that
starts with that letter first one that
comes to mind okay now take the last
letter of that animal species name and
come up with a color that the animal
could be alright once you've got all
those things I'm gonna read your mind so
you are probably thinking of an orange
kangaroo that lives in Denmark right
that's funny because there are no orange
kangaroos in Denmark and I don't know
why you thought that but I have some
kind of a clue see with this mind trick
I limited your options at the very start
to by having you pick a number from 1 to
10 I don't know if you caught on us but
that's what I had you do and then I
you do all this random math but was it
really random no because it was all
leading up to this subtraction
subtracting the new number or the
original number rather from the new name
and then that gives you four right it
gives you for that is if you did the
math right and then once you look at all
these little numbers on here with their
letters I wrote all them to trick you
you would see that D falls under four so
that would leave you with thinking of a
country that begins to the letter D
what's that country huh first one that
comes to mind Denmark sound familiar
all right take the last letter of that
country okay what's the first animal
species that comes to mind maybe koala
but no kangaroo is much more preferable
by everyone so you guys picked the
kangaroo and then lastly the color

what's the last letter of the kangaroo
Oh orange is the only color I can think
of that begins with an O there could be
others maybe Crayola colors but orange
is the most common so thus you thought
of an orange kangaroo in Denmark wasn't
that an interesting trick you could play
this trick on anyone and it's more much
more effective one to one than it is in
a group setting because people might be
able to catch on I don't know if you
guys meant some of you were able to
catch on but there's the factor of pure
influence in there and that's just not
the same when you're you know one one
two one scenario
so this this trick is very effective
because it bends your perception of
things and it gets you to think a
certain way and these tricks are useful
because they get us thinking in that
different way and they're just fun to
play with friends they're fun to to to
do as it's sort of entertainment with
your friends so if you're bored or you
have little to do on the weekends I
encourage you to pull out this this
little tricks just search warrant
kangaroo mind trick on the internet and
just play that front and play that joke
on or play that mind trick rather on
your friends or family see how they
react so I thank you for listening to my
speech and I hope you've enjoyed this
little trick that I am demonstrating
thank you so much for listening",Demonstrative
